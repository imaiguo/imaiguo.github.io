<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和华你神将他们交给你击杀，那时你要把他们灭绝净尽，不可与他们立约，也不可恩待他们。<br>And Jehovah your God delivers them up before you and you defeat them, you shall utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor shall you show them any favor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>不可与他们结亲：不可将你的女儿嫁给他们的儿子，也不可为你的儿子娶他们的女儿；<br>And you shall not make marriage alliances with them: Your daughters you shall not give to their sons, and their daughters you shall not take for your sons;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>因为他们必使你儿子转离不跟从我，去事奉别神，以致耶和华的怒气向你们发作，就速速的将你们灭绝。<br>For they will draw your sons away from following after Me to serve other gods, and the anger of Jehovah will burn against you and He will quickly destroy you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>你们却要这样待他们：拆毁他们的祭坛，打碎他们的柱像，砍下他们的木像，用火焚烧他们雕制的偶像。<br>But you shall deal with them in this way: Their altars you shall tear down, their pillars you shall shatter, their Asherahs you shall hew down, and their idols you shall burn with fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>因为你是归耶和华你神的圣别子民；耶和华你神从地上的万民中拣选你，作祂自己的珍宝，作祂的子民。<br>For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God; it is you whom Jehovah your God has chosen from among all the peoples which are upon the face of the earth to be a people for His personal treasure.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>耶和华钟情于你们，拣选你们，并非因你们多于别民，原来你们在万民中是最少的；<br>It was not because you were more numerous than all the peoples that Jehovah has set His affection on you and has chosen you, for you were the fewest of all the peoples;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>乃因耶和华爱你们，又因要守祂向你们列祖所起的誓，就用大能的手领你们出来，把你们从为奴之家，从埃及王法老的手中救赎出来。<br>Rather, because Jehovah loved you and because He would keep the oath which He swore to your fathers, Jehovah has brought you out with a mighty hand and ransomed you from the slave house, from the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>7:13</a></td><td class=td>祂必爱你，赐福与你，使你人数增多，也必在祂向你列祖起誓要赐给你的地上，赐福与你身所生的、地所产的，并你的五谷、新酒和新油，以及牛犊、羊羔。<br>And He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your fresh oil, the offspring of your cattle and the young of your flock, on the land which He swore to your fathers to give you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>你必蒙福胜过万民；你们的男女没有不能生养的，牲畜也没有不能生育的。<br>You will be more blessed than all other peoples; there will not be any barren male or female among you or among your animals.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>耶和华必使一切的病症离开你；你所知道埃及各样的恶疾，祂必不加在你身上，只加给一切恨你的人。<br>And Jehovah will remove every sickness from you, and none of the evil illnesses of Egypt, which you know about, will He put upon you; but He will give them to all who hate you.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>7:22</a></td><td class=td>耶和华你神要渐渐的将这些国民从你面前除掉；你不可把他们速速灭尽，免得田野的兽多起来害你。<br>And Jehovah your God will clear away these nations from before you little by little; you shall not devour all of them immediately, lest the beasts of the field multiply against you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>7:23</a></td><td class=td>耶和华你神必将他们交给你，大大的扰乱他们，直到他们灭绝了。<br>But Jehovah your God will deliver them up before you and rout them utterly until they are destroyed.</td></tr>
