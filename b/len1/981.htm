<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>但有别的落在好土里，生长起来，结实百倍。耶稣说了这些话，就大声说，有耳可听的，就应当听。<br>And other seed fell into the good earth, and when it grew, it produced fruit a hundredfold. When He had said these things, He called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>8:9</a></td><td class=td>门徒问祂这比喻是什么意思。<br>And His disciples questioned Him as to what this parable might be. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>8:11</a></td><td class=td>这比喻乃是这样：种子就是神的道。<br>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>8:12</a></td><td class=td>那些在路旁的，就是人听了道，随后魔鬼来，从他们心里把道夺去，恐怕他们信了得救。<br>And those beside the way are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they would not believe and be saved. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>因为隐藏的事没有不成为显明的，隐瞒的事也绝没有不被人知道而暴露出来的。<br>For nothing is hidden which shall not become manifest, nor concealed which shall not by all means be made known and come into the open. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>8:25</a></td><td class=td>耶稣对他们说，你们的信心在那里？他们既惧怕，又希奇，彼此说，这人到底是谁？祂竟吩咐风和水，连风和水也听从了祂。<br>And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they became frightened and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He orders even the winds and the water, and they obey Him? </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>8:27</a></td><td class=td>耶稣一上岸，就有一个鬼附的人，从城里出来迎着祂。这人已经许久不穿衣服，不住房子，只住在坟茔间。<br>And when He went out onto the land, a certain man out of the city, who had demons, met Him, and for a considerable time he had not put on clothes and did not remain in a house but among the tombs. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>8:28</a></td><td class=td>他看见耶稣，就喊叫起来，俯伏在祂面前，大声说，至高神的儿子耶稣，我与你何干？求你不要叫我受苦。<br>And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him and said in a loud voice, What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech You, do not torment me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>8:29</a></td><td class=td>因耶稣曾吩咐污灵从那人身上出来；原来这鬼屡次抓住他，他常被人看守，又被铁链和脚镣捆锁，他竟把锁链挣断，被鬼催逼到旷野去。<br>For He had charged the unclean spirit to come out from the man; for many times it had seized him and he had been bound with chains and shackles and was kept under watch, yet every time he tore the bonds apart and was driven by the demon into the wilderness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>8:30</a></td><td class=td>耶稣问他说，你名叫什么？他说，我名叫群，因为有许多鬼进入他里面。<br>And Jesus questioned him, What is your name? And he said, Legion, because many demons had entered into him. </td></tr>
