Take all the people of war with you, and rise and go up to Ai. See, I have given the king of Ai and his people and his city and his land into your hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>你怎样待耶利哥和耶利哥的王，也当照样待艾城和艾城的王；只是城内所夺的财物和牲畜，你们可以取为自己的掠物。你要在城后设下攻城的伏兵。<br>And you shall do to Ai and to its king as you did to Jericho and to its king; except its spoil and its cattle you shall take for your plunder. Set an ambush for the city behind it.</td></tr>
