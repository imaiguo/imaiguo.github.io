<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>42:2</a></td><td class=td>这圣屋长一百肘，有向北的门，屋宽五十肘。<br>The length of the side of the northern entrance was a hundred cubits, and the width was fifty cubits.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>42:5</a></td><td class=td>上层圣屋因为楼廊占去些地方，所以比中下两层窄些。<br>Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more space away from these than from the lower and the middle stories in the building.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>42:6</a></td><td class=td>因为圣屋有三层，却无柱子，不像外院的屋子有柱子；所以上层比中下两层更窄。<br>For they were arranged in three stories, and they did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper story was set back from the ground more than the lower and middle stories  .</td></tr>

Their appear  ance was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north; just as their length, so also was their width; and all their exits were according to both their arrangements and their entrances.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>42:13</a></td><td class=td>祂对我说，在空地旁边的南屋和北屋，都是圣屋；亲近耶和华的祭司当在那里吃至圣的物，也当在那里放至圣的物，就是素祭、赎罪祭和赎愆祭，因那地方是圣别的。<br>Then He said to me, The north chambers and the south chambers which are beside the separate place are holy chambers, where the priests who are near to Jehovah shall eat the most holy things. There they put down the most holy things, the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering, for the place is holy.</td></tr>

And they shall put on other garments and approach the area designated for the people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>42:15</a></td><td class=td>祂量完了内殿，就带我出朝东的门，量院的四围。<br>Now when He had finished measuring the inner house, He brought me out through the gate which faces toward the east and measured it all around.</td></tr>
