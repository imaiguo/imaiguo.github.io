<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>53:1</a></td><td class=td>我们所传的，有谁信呢？耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？<br>Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>53:2</a></td><td class=td>祂在耶和华面前生长如嫩芽，像根出于干地。祂无佳形华美叫我们观看祂，也无美貌使我们羡慕祂。<br>For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, And like a root out of dry  ground. He has no attracting form nor  majesty that we should look  upon Him, Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>53:3</a></td><td class=td>祂被藐视，被人厌弃，多受痛苦，常经忧患；祂被藐视，好像被人掩面不看的一样；我们也不尊重祂。<br>He was despised and forsaken of  men, A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; And like one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised; and we did not esteem Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>53:4</a></td><td class=td>祂诚然担当了我们的忧患，背负了我们的痛苦；我们却以为祂受责罚，被神击打苦待了。<br>Surely He has borne our  sicknesses, And carried our sorrows; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God and afflicted.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>53:5</a></td><td class=td>那知祂为我们的过犯受创，为我们的罪孽压伤；因祂受的刑罚我们得平安，因祂受的鞭伤我们得医治。<br>But He was wounded because of our transgressions; He was crushed because of our iniquities; The chastening for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we have been healed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>53:6</a></td><td class=td>我们都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路；耶和华使我们众人的罪孽都归在祂身上。<br>We all like sheep have gone astray; Each of us has turned to his own way, And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>53:7</a></td><td class=td>祂被欺压，受苦却不开口；祂像羊羔被牵去宰杀，又像羊在剪毛的人面前无声，祂也是这样不开口。<br>He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>53:8</a></td><td class=td>因受欺压和审判祂被夺去；至于祂那世代的人，谁想祂是因我百姓的过犯，受他们所当受的鞭打，从活人之地被剪除呢？<br>By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who among them had the thought That He was cut off out of the land of the living For the transgression of my peopleto whom the stroke was due?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>53:9</a></td><td class=td>祂虽然未行强暴，口中也没有诡诈，人还使祂与恶人同埋，谁知死的时候与财主同葬。<br>And they assigned His grave with the wicked, But with a rich man in His death, Although He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>53:10</a></td><td class=td>耶和华却喜悦将祂压伤，使祂受痛苦。祂使自己成了为着罪的祭，祂必看见后裔，并且延长年日；耶和华所喜悦的事，必在祂手中亨通。<br>But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief. When He makes Himself an offering for sin, He will see a seed, He will extend His days, And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>53:11</a></td><td class=td>祂必看见自己劳苦的果效，便心满意足；有许多人，因认识那义者我的仆人而成为义的；并且祂要担当他们的罪孽。<br>He will see the fruit of the travail of His soul,  And He will be satisfied; By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous, And He will bear their iniquities.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>53:12</a></td><td class=td>所以我要使祂与至大者同分，与至强者均分掳物；因为祂将命倾倒，以至于死，且被算在罪犯之中；惟独祂担当多人的罪，又为罪犯代求。<br>Therefore I will divide to Him a portion with the Great, And He will divide the spoil with the Strong; Because He poured out His life unto death And was numbered with the transgressors, Yet He alone bore the sin of many And interceded for the transgressors.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
