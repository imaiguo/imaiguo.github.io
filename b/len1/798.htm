<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>1:1</a></td><td class=td>先前满有人民的城，现在何竟独坐！先前在列国中为大的，现在竟如寡妇；先前在诸省中为王后的，现在成了进贡的。<br>How the city sits alone That was full of people! She who was once great among the nations Has become like a widow; She who was a princess among the provinces Has become tributary.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>1:2</a></td><td class=td>她夜间痛哭，泪流满腮。在她一切所爱的人中间，没有一个安慰她的；她的朋友，都以诡诈待她，成了她的仇敌。<br>Bitterly she weeps in the night, And her tears are on her cheeks. There is no one to comfort her Among all her lovers; All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; They have become her enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>1:3</a></td><td class=td>犹大遭遇苦难，多服劳役，被迁到外邦；她住在列国中，寻不着安息；在急难中，一切追逼她的人将她追上了。<br>Judah has gone into exile, away from affliction And away from great servitude; She dwells among the nations But finds no rest; All her pursuers have overtaken her In the midst of distress.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>1:4</a></td><td class=td>锡安的路径，因无人来守所定的节期就悲伤；她的城门凄凉，她的祭司叹息；她的处女受艰难，自己也在愁苦中。<br>The ways of Zion mourn, For no one comes to the appointed feast; All her gates are desolate; Her priests groan; Her virgins are afflicted, And she is in bitterness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>1:5</a></td><td class=td>她的敌人为首；她的仇敌亨通；因为她的过犯众多，耶和华使她受苦；她的孩童在敌人面前被掳去。<br>Her adversaries have become the head; Her enemies prosper; For Jehovah has afflicted her Because of the multitude of her transgressions; Her little ones have gone into  captivity Before the adversary.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>1:6</a></td><td class=td>锡安女子的威荣，全都离去；她的首领，像找不着草场的鹿，在追赶的人面前，无力行走。<br>And all her majesty has departed From the daughter of Zion; Her princes have become like deer That find no pasture, And they have fled without strength Before the pursuer.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>1:7</a></td><td class=td>耶路撒冷在困苦流离之时，就追想古时一切的美事；她百姓落在敌人手中，无人救助；敌人看见她，就嗤笑她的衰败。<br>In the days of her affliction and her wanderings, Jerusalem remembers All her precious things Which were in the days of old, When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, And there was no one to help her. The adversaries saw her; They mocked at her downfall.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>1:8</a></td><td class=td>耶路撒冷大大的犯罪，所以成了不洁之物。素来尊敬她的，见她赤露就都藐视她；她自己也叹息，转身退后。<br>Jerusalem has sinned grievously; Therefore she has become an impurity. All who honored her despise her, Because they have seen her nakedness; And she groans And turns backwards.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>1:9</a></td><td class=td>她的污秽是在衣裙上；她不思想自己末后的结局；所以她令人惊奇的败落，无人安慰她。她说，耶和华阿，求你看我的苦难，因为仇敌自夸为大。<br>Her uncleanness is in her skirts; She did not remember her latter end; Therefore she has come down astonishingly; There is no one to comfort her. O Jehovah, see my affliction, For the enemy has magnified himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>1:10</a></td><td class=td>敌人伸手，夺取她的一切美物；她眼见外邦人进入她的圣所；论到这外邦人，你曾吩咐不可入你的会中。<br>The adversary has spread out his  hand Over all her precious things, For she has seen the nations Enter her sanctuary, Concerning whom You commanded that they should not enter Into Your assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>1:11</a></td><td class=td>她的民都叹息，寻求食物；他们用美物换粮食，要救回性命。他们说，耶和华阿，求你观看，因为我成了被藐视的。<br>All her people groan; They seek bread; They have given their precious things for food To restore their soul. See, O Jehovah, and look, For I have become despised.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>1:12</a></td><td class=td>你们一切过路的人哪，这事你们不介意么？你们要观看，有什么痛苦像我所遭受的痛苦，就是耶和华在祂发烈怒的日子，使我所受的苦。<br>Is it nothing to you, all who pass by the way? Look and see If there is any pain like my pain Which is dealt to me, Whom Jehovah has afflicted In the day of His burning anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>1:13</a></td><td class=td>祂从高天使火进入我的骨头，胜过了我；祂铺下网罗，绊我的脚，使我转回退后；祂使我终日凄凉发昏。<br>He has sent fire from on high Into my bones, and it prevails against them; He has spread out a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me a desolation And faint all the day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>1:14</a></td><td class=td>我过犯的轭，是祂手所绑的，都纠缠在一起，上到我的颈项；祂使我的力量衰败。主将我交在我所不能敌挡的人手中。<br>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand; They are knit together; They have come up upon my neck; He has made my strength fail; The Lord has delivered me into  hands From which I am not able to rise  up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>1:15</a></td><td class=td>主轻弃我中间的一切勇士；祂招聚会众攻击我，要压碎我的少年人。主将犹大的处女踹踏，像在酒醡中一样。<br>The Lord has made light of all my mighty men In my midst; He has called an assembly against  me To crush my young men. The Lord has trodden, as in a  winepress, The virgin daughter of Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>1:16</a></td><td class=td>我因这些事哭泣；我的眼睛泪水直流，因为那当安慰我，救回我性命的，离我甚远；我的儿女凄苦，因为仇敌已经得胜。<br>For these things I weep; My eye, my eye runs down with water, For the comforter who should revive my soul Is far from me; My children have become desolate, Because the enemy has prevailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>1:17</a></td><td class=td>锡安伸出双手，无人安慰；论到雅各，耶和华已经出令，使四围的人作他仇敌；耶路撒冷在他们中间，成了不洁之物。<br>Zion stretches out her hands, Yet there is no one to comfort  her. Jehovah has commanded concerning Jacob That those around him should be his adversaries; Jerusalem has become an impurity Among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>1:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和华是公义的，因我违背了祂的命令。众民哪，请听我的话，看我的痛苦；我的处女和少年人，都被掳去了。<br>Jehovah is righteous, For I have rebelled against His commandment. Hear now, all the peoples, And see my pain; My virgins and my young men Have gone into captivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>1:19</a></td><td class=td>我招呼我所爱的人，他们却愚弄我；我的祭司和长老，正寻求食物要救回性命的时候，就在城中灭亡。<br>I have called to my lovers; They have deceived me; My priests and my elders Have perished in the city, While they sought food for  themselves To restore their souls.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>1:20</a></td><td class=td>耶和华阿，求你观看，因为我在急难中，我的心肠翻腾；我的心在我里面翻转，因我曾经大大的悖逆。在街上刀剑使人丧子，在屋里犹如死亡。<br>See, O Jehovah, for I am in  distress, My bowels are in ferment; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword bereaves; In the house it is like death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>1:21</a></td><td class=td>他们听见我叹息，却无人安慰我；我的仇敌都听见我的患难；因你作了这事，他们就都欢喜。你必使你宣告的日子来到，他们就要像我一样。<br>They have heard that I groan; There is no one to comfort me; All my enemies have heard of my trouble; They are glad that You have done  it. You will bring the day that You have proclaimed, And they will be like me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>1:22</a></td><td class=td>愿他们的恶，都呈到你面前；你怎样因我的一切过犯待我，求你照样待他们；因我叹息甚多，我的心发昏。<br>Let all their wickedness come  before You, And deal with them As You have dealt with me For all my transgressions; For my sighs are many, And my heart is faint.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
