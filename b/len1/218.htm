And the camp of Midian was to their north, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>现在你要宣告使百姓听见，说，凡惧怕战栗的，可以离开这里回去。于是有二万二千人回去，只剩下一万。<br>Now then proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, Whoever is afraid and trembling should return and depart from  here. And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.</td></tr>

Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. And he of whom I say to you, This one shall go with you, he shall go with you. And every one of whom I say to you, This one shall not go with you, he shall not go.</td></tr>

And Jehovah said to Gideon, Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.</td></tr>

And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>7:9</a></td><td class=td>当那夜，耶和华对基甸说，起来，下去攻营，因我已将那营交在你手中。<br>And that night Jehovah said to him, Arise; go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>倘若你怕下去，就带你的仆人普拉下到营那里去。<br>But if you are afraid to go down, go down with Purah your young man into the camp;</td></tr>

There was this round loaf of barley bread tumbling through the camp of Midian. And it came to the tent and struck it, so that it fell and turned upside down. And the tent collapsed.</td></tr>

And they cried out, A sword for Jehovah and for Gideon!</td></tr>

And the camp fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>7:23</a></td><td class=td>以色列人就从拿弗他利、亚设、和全玛拿西，应召来追赶米甸人。<br>And the men of Israel were called up from Naphtali and from Asher and from all of Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.</td></tr>
