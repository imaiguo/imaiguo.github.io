And Ahab slaughtered sheep and oxen in abundance for him and for the people who were with him, and persuaded him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>18:3</a></td><td class=td>以色列王亚哈问犹大王约沙法说，你肯同我去进攻基列的拉末么？他回答说，你我不分彼此，我的民如同你的民，我们必与你一同作战。<br>And Ahab the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And  Jehoshaphat said to him, I will be as you are; my people will be as your people; we will be with you in battle.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>18:11</a></td><td class=td>所有的申言者也都这样豫言，说，可以上基列的拉末去，必然顺利，因为耶和华必将那城交在王的手中。<br>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and succeed; for Jehovah will deliver it into the king's hand.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>18:16</a></td><td class=td>米该雅说，我看见以色列众民散在山上，如同没有牧人的羊群一般。耶和华说，这些人没有主人，他们可以平平安安的各归各家去。<br>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>18:18</a></td><td class=td>米该雅说，因此，你们要听耶和华的话；我看见耶和华坐在宝座上，天上的万军侍立在祂左右。<br>And Micaiah said, Hear therefore the word of Jehovah, I saw Jehovah sitting on His throne and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and His left.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>18:31</a></td><td class=td>车兵长看见约沙法，便说，这必是以色列王；他们就围绕他，与他争战。约沙法呼喊，耶和华就帮助他；神驱使他们离开他。<br>And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, This is the king of Israel.
