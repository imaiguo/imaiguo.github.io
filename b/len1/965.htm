<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>8:28</a></td><td class=td>他们对祂说，有人说是施浸者约翰，另有人说是以利亚，还有别人说是申言者中的一位。<br>And they told Him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, one of the prophets. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>8:34</a></td><td class=td>于是耶稣叫群众同祂的门徒来，对他们说，若有人要跟从我，就当否认己，背起他的十字架，并跟从我。<br>And He called the crowd to Him with His disciples and said to them, If anyone wants to follow after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>8:35</a></td><td class=td>因为凡要救自己魂生命的，必丧失魂生命；凡为我和福音丧失自己魂生命的，必救了魂生命。<br>For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel's shall save it. </td></tr>
