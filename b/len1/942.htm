<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>13:5</a></td><td class=td>又有的落在土浅石头地上，土既不深，立刻发苗；<br>And others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much earth, and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of earth. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>13:10</a></td><td class=td>门徒进前来，对祂说，你对众人讲话，为什么用比喻？<br>And the disciples came and said to Him, Why do You speak in parables to them? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>13:11</a></td><td class=td>祂回答说，因为诸天之国的奥秘，只给你们知道，不给他们知道。<br>And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>13:12</a></td><td class=td>因为凡有的，还要给他，他就充盈有余；凡没有的，连他所有的，也要从他夺去。<br>For whoever has, it shall be given to him, and he will abound; but whoever does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>13:13</a></td><td class=td>所以我用比喻对他们讲，因为他们看却看不见，听也听不见，也不领悟。<br>For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>13:14</a></td><td class=td>在他们身上，应验了以赛亚的申言，说，“你们听是要听见，却绝不领悟；看是要看见，却绝看不透。<br>And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, "In hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>13:15</a></td><td class=td>因为这百姓心蒙脂油，耳听不灵，眼睛闭着；恐怕他们眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里领悟，回转过来，我就医治他们。”<br>For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them.'' </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>13:17</a></td><td class=td>我实在告诉你们，曾经有许多申言者和义人，渴想要看你们所看的，却没有看见；要听你们所听的，却没有听见。 <br>For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>13:22</a></td><td class=td>还有那撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，后来有今世的思虑，和钱财的迷惑，把道全然挤住了，道就不能结实。<br>And the one sown in the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches utterly choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>13:23</a></td><td class=td>但那撒在好土里的，就是人听了道，也领悟了，他就结出果实，有的结了一百倍，有的六十倍，有的三十倍。<br>But the one sown on the good earth, this is he who hears the word and understands, who by all means bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>13:24</a></td><td class=td>耶稣在他们跟前另设一个比喻，说，诸天的国好比人撒好种在他的田里；<br>Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>13:25</a></td><td class=td>及至人们睡觉的时候，他的仇敌来了，将稗子撒在麦子中间，就走了。<br>But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>13:26</a></td><td class=td>到长苗吐穗的时候，稗子也显出来。<br>And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>13:27</a></td><td class=td>家主的奴仆就进前来对他说，主啊，你不是撒好种在你的田里么？从那里来的稗子？<br>And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did the tares come from? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>13:28</a></td><td class=td>他就对他们说，这是仇敌作的。奴仆就对他说，那么你要我们去薅集它们么？<br>And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and collect them? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>13:29</a></td><td class=td>他就说，不，免得薅集稗子，连麦子也一齐带根薅出来。<br>But he said, No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>13:30</a></td><td class=td>让这两样一齐长，直到收割。在收割的时候，我要对收割的人说，先薅集稗子，捆成捆，好把它们烧了，麦子却要收到我的仓里。<br>Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>13:31</a></td><td class=td>耶稣在他们跟前另设一个比喻，说，诸天的国好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在他的田里。<br>Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>13:32</a></td><td class=td>这乃是百种里最小的，但长起来，却比别的菜都大，且成了树，甚至天空的飞鸟来栖宿在它的枝上。<br>And which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>13:33</a></td><td class=td>祂对他们另讲一个比喻说，诸天的国好像面酵，有妇人拿去藏在三斗面里，直到全团都发了酵。<br>Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>13:34</a></td><td class=td>耶稣用比喻对群众讲说这一切的事，若不用比喻，就不对他们说什么。<br>All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and apart from a parable He spoke nothing to them, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>13:35</a></td><td class=td>这是要应验那借着申言者所说的，说，“我要开口用比喻，把创世以来所隐藏的事说出来。”<br>So that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.'' </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>13:37</a></td><td class=td>祂就回答说，那撒好种的就是人子，<br>And He answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>13:38</a></td><td class=td>田地就是世界，好种就是国度之子，稗子就是恶者之子，<br>And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>13:39</a></td><td class=td>撒稗子的仇敌就是魔鬼，收割的时候就是这世代的终结，收割的人就是天使。<br>And the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=41>13:41</a></td><td class=td>人子要差遣祂的使者，从祂的国里薅集一切绊跌人的事，和行不法的人，<br>The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will collect out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=42>13:42</a></td><td class=td>且要把他们丢到火炉里，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。<br>And will cast them into the furnace of fire. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. </td></tr>
