There will yet arise three kings in Persia; then the fourth will gain great riches, more than all of them; and once he becomes strong because of his riches, he will stir up the whole empire against the realm of Javan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>11:3</a></td><td class=td>必有一个有能力的王兴起，执掌大权，随意而行。<br>And a mighty king will arise there, and he will rule with great dominion and do as he pleases.</td></tr>

And the daughter of the king of the south will go to the king of the north and make a treaty; but she will not retain the strength of her arm, nor will he and his arm stand; but she will be given up, along with those who brought her into the alliance and him who begot her and supported her in those times.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>11:24</a></td><td class=td>他趁人安稳的时候，必进到国中极肥美之地，行他列祖和他列祖之祖所未曾行的；他必将掳物、掠物和财宝，散给众人；又设计攻打保障，然而这都是暂时的。<br>In a time of security he will enter even the richest parts of the kingdom and will do that which his fathers never did, nor his fathers' fathers; prey, spoil, and riches will he scatter among them, and against strongholds he will  devise strategies, but only for a while.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>11:25</a></td><td class=td>他必奋力鼓勇，率领大军攻击南方王；南方王也必以极大极强的军兵与他争战，却站立不住，因为有人设计谋害南方王。<br>And he will stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will stir himself up to wage war with an extremely great and mighty army of his own; but he will not stand, for strategies will have been devised against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>11:26</a></td><td class=td>那些吃王膳食的，必毁坏他；他的军队必如洪水泛滥，多人必被杀仆倒。<br>And those who eat of his choice provision will destroy him; and his army will overflow, and many will fall down slain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>11:27</a></td><td class=td>至于这二王，他们心怀邪恶，同席说谎；但所行的必不成功，因为到了定期，结局才来到。<br>And as for both of these kings, their hearts will be to do evil, and they will speak lies across one table; but what they do will not succeed, for the end is still at the appointed time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>11:28</a></td><td class=td>北方王必带许多财宝回往本地；他的心却反对圣约，任意而行，回到本地。<br>Then the  king of the north will return to his land with great riches; but his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and will return to his land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>11:29</a></td><td class=td>到了定期，他必返回，来攻南方；但这后一次，却不如前一次，<br>At the appointed time he will return and come against the south; but this latter time will not be like the former time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>11:30</a></td><td class=td>因为基提战船必来攻击他，他就丧胆而回；又要恼恨圣约，任意而行；他必回来，特别留意背弃圣约的人。<br>For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will turn away; and he will be enraged at the holy covenant and will take action. When he turns away, he will focus his attention on those who forsake the holy covenant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>11:31</a></td><td class=td>他必起兵亵渎圣所，就是保障，且要除掉日常的献祭；他们必设立那造成荒凉的可憎之物。<br>And forces from him will arise and profane the sanctuary, establishing the fortress and removing the daily sacrifice; and they will set up the abomination that desolates.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>11:32</a></td><td class=td>作恶违背圣约的人，他必用花言巧语使他们被玷污；惟独认识神的子民，必刚强行事。<br>And with his smooth words he will cause those who act wickedly toward the covenant to be profane. But the people who know their God will show strength and take action.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>11:33</a></td><td class=td>民间的通达人，必训诲多人，然而他们多日必倒在刀下，或被火烧，或被掳掠抢夺。<br>And those with insight among the people will cause the many to understand; yet they will fall by sword and by flames, by captivity and by plundering for some days.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>11:34</a></td><td class=td>他们跌倒的时候，稍得扶助；有许多人只用谄媚的话依附他们。<br>And when they fall, they will be helped with a little help; and many will join themselves to them  in word only.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>11:39</a></td><td class=td>他必靠外邦神明的帮助，攻击最坚固的保障；凡承认他的，他必将荣耀加给他们，使他们管辖许多人，又分地赏给他们。<br>And he will take action against the most fortified of fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will increase the honor of those who acknowledge him and will cause them to rule over many, and he will divide the land to them as a reward.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=40>11:40</a></td><td class=td>到了末时，南方王要与他交战，北方王必用战车、马兵、和许多战船，势如暴风来攻击他，也必进入列国，如洪水冲没泛滥；<br>And at the time of the end the king of the south will push against him, and the king of the north will storm back at him with chariots and horsemen and many ships; and he will enter the countries and overflow and pass through.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=41>11:41</a></td><td class=td>又必进入荣美之地，有许多国就被倾覆；但以东人、摩押人、和亚扪人中为首的，必脱离他的手。<br>He will also enter the beautiful land, and many countries will fall; but these will slip away from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the foremost of the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=42>11:42</a></td><td class=td>他必伸手攻击列国；埃及地也不得逃脱。<br>Then he will stretch forth his hand against the countries, and for the land of Egypt there will be no escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=43>11:43</a></td><td class=td>他必把持埃及人隐藏的金银财宝，和各样的宝物；吕彼亚人和古实人，都必跟从他的脚步。<br>And he will have control over the hidden stores of gold and silver and over all the precious things of the Egyptians; and the Libyans and Cushites will follow in his steps.</td></tr>
