Both the unmarried woman and the virgin care for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she who has married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>7:35</a></td><td class=td>我说这话，是为你们自己的益处；不是要牢笼你们，乃是要叫你们行合宜的事，得以殷勤服事主，没有分心的事。<br>But this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a noose upon you but that you may be comely and may wait on the Lord without distraction. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>7:36</a></td><td class=td>若有人以为待他的童身女儿不合宜，她也过了华龄，事又当行，他就可随愿办理，不是犯罪，让他们结婚。<br>But if anyone thinks that he is behaving unbecomingly to his virgin daughter, if she is past the bloom of youth and thus it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>7:37</a></td><td class=td>但他若心里坚定，没有不得已的事，对自己的意思又有主权，心里也决定了留下自己的童身女儿，如此行也好。<br>But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, and has authority with respect to his own will and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>7:38</a></td><td class=td>这样看来，叫自己的童身女儿出嫁是好，不叫她出嫁更是好。<br>So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>7:39</a></td><td class=td>丈夫活着的时候，妻子是被束缚的；丈夫若睡了，妻子就可以自由，随愿嫁人，只是要嫁在主里的人。<br>A wife is bound for so long a time as her husband lives; but should the husband fall asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only to one in the Lord. </td></tr>
