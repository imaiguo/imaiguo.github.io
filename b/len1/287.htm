And he blew the trumpet and said, We have no portion in David, Nor do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, O Israel!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>20:2</a></td><td class=td>于是以色列人都离开大卫上去，不跟随他，却跟随比基利的儿子示巴；但犹大人从约但河直到耶路撒冷，都紧紧跟随他们的王。<br>And all the men of Israel went up from following David  and followed Sheba the son of Bichri, but the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>20:3</a></td><td class=td>大卫王来到耶路撒冷自己的宫中，就把从前留下看守宫殿的十个妃嫔放在禁宫里，供养她们，但不与她们亲近。她们被拘禁，过着如同寡妇的生活，直到死的日子。<br>And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them under guard; and he provided for them but did not go in unto them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living like widows.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>20:4</a></td><td class=td>王对亚玛撒说，你要在三日之内将犹大人召集到我这里来，你也要在这里。<br>Then the king said to Amasa, Call the men of Judah to me in three days, and you be present here.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>20:6</a></td><td class=td>大卫对亚比筛说，现在比基利的儿子示巴必加害我们，比押沙龙更甚。你要带着你主的仆人追赶他，免得他得了坚固城，从我们眼前逃脱。<br>Then David said to Abishai, Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. You take servants of your lord and pursue after him; otherwise he will find himself some fortified cities and escape out of our sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>20:7</a></td><td class=td>约押的人和基利提人、比利提人、并所有的勇士，都跟着亚比筛，从耶路撒冷出去，追赶比基利的儿子示巴。<br>So the men of Joab went out after him, along with the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men; and they went forth from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</td></tr>

And Joab was in military dress, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath, fastened on his loins; and when he went forward, it fell out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>20:9</a></td><td class=td>约押左手拾起刀来，对亚玛撒说，我兄弟，你平安么？就用右手抓住亚玛撒的胡子，要与他亲嘴。亚玛撒没有防备约押手里所拿的刀；约押用刀刺入他的肚腹，他的肠子流在地上；没有再刺他，他就死了。<br>And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother? And he took hold of Amasa's beard with his right hand to kiss him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>20:10</a></td><td class=td>约押和他兄弟亚比筛往前追赶比基利的儿子示巴。<br>But Amasa did not notice the sword which was in Joab's hand. And Joab struck him in the stomach with it and poured out his bowels onto the ground, and he did not  strike him a second time; and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>20:11</a></td><td class=td>有约押的一个少年人站在亚玛撒尸身旁边，说，谁喜悦约押，谁归顺大卫，就当跟随约押去。<br>And one of Joab's young men stood by him and said, Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>20:12</a></td><td class=td>亚玛撒在路当中，辊在自己的血里；那少年人看见众民都站住。他见所有来到亚玛撒尸身旁的人都站住，就把尸身从大路挪到田间，把一件衣服扔在其上。<br>And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the people stood still. And when he saw that all who came by him were stopping, he carried Amasa off the road into the field and put a garment over him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>20:13</a></td><td class=td>尸身从大路挪移之后，众民就都过去，跟随约押去追赶比基利的儿子示巴。<br>As soon as he was removed from the road, all the men went on after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>20:14</a></td><td class=td>示巴走遍以色列各支派，直到伯玛迦和亚比拉，并所有比利人之地；那些地方的人也都聚集跟随他。<br>And Sheba went on throughout all the tribes of Israel to Abel and to Beth- maacah and unto all the Berites; and they gathered together and also went after him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>20:15</a></td><td class=td>约押和跟随的人到了亚比拉和伯玛迦，围困示巴，就对着城筑垒，与城外的外墙相对而立；跟随约押的众民撞击城墙，要使墙塌陷。<br>And they came and besieged him at Abel of Beth-maacah; and they cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>20:16</a></td><td class=td>有一个聪明的妇人从城上呼叫说，听阿，听阿，请对约押说，你走近这里来，我好与你说话。<br>And a wise woman from the city cried out, Listen! Listen! Say to Joab, Come near here that I may speak to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>20:17</a></td><td class=td>约押就走近妇人那里，妇人说，你是约押不是？他说，我是。妇人说，请你听婢女的话。约押说，我在听。<br>And he came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab? And Joab said, I am. And she said to him, Listen to the words of your female servant. And he said, I am listening.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>20:18</a></td><td class=td>妇人说，古时有话说，当先在亚比拉求问，然后事就定妥。<br>Then she spoke, saying, They used to speak in former times, saying, They shall surely ask  for counsel in Abel; and thus they would end  matters.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>20:19</a></td><td class=td>我们这城的人在以色列人中是和平、忠信的；你竟想要毁坏以色列中的大城。你为何要吞灭耶和华的产业呢？<br>I am of the peaceable  and faithful of Israel; you are seeking to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>20:20</a></td><td class=td>约押回答说，绝不是，我绝不吞灭毁坏。<br>And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I would swallow up or destroy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>20:21</a></td><td class=td>事情不是这样，是因以法莲山地的一个人，比基利的儿子名叫示巴，举手攻击大卫王。你们只要将他一个人交出来，我便离城而去。妇人对约押说，那人的首级必从城墙上丢给你。<br>The matter is not so, but a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, His head will immediately be thrown over the wall to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>20:22</a></td><td class=td>于是妇人凭她的智慧去劝众人；他们便割下比基利的儿子示巴的首级，丢给约押。约押吹角，众人就离城而散，各人回自己的帐棚去了。约押回耶路撒冷，到王那里。<br>So the woman went to all the people in her wisdom; and they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw  it to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.</td></tr>
