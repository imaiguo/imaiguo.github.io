<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>5:30</a></td><td class=td>法利赛人和他们的经学家就向耶稣的门徒发怨言，说，你们为什么和税吏并罪人一同吃喝？<br>And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured at His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>5:31</a></td><td class=td>耶稣回答他们说，健康的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着；<br>And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill; </td></tr>
