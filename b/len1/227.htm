So they surrounded him and set an ambush for him all night long in the gate of the city. And they were quiet all night long, saying among themselves, We will stay here until the light of morning; then we will slay him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>16:3</a></td><td class=td>参孙睡到半夜，起来，抓住城门的门扇和两边的门框，与门闩一齐拔起来，扛在肩上，扛到希伯仑前的山顶上。<br>But Samson lay only until midnight; then he rose at midnight and grasped the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts, and he plucked them up along with the bar; and he put them on his shoulders and brought them up to the top of the mountain that is in front of Hebron.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>16:4</a></td><td class=td>后来，参孙在梭烈谷爱上了一个妇人，名叫大利拉。<br>Then after this he fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>16:5</a></td><td class=td>非利士人的首领上去见那妇人，对她说，求你诓哄参孙，看看他为何有这么大的力气，我们用何法才能胜过他，捆绑克制他；我们就每人给你一千一百锭银子。<br>And the lords of the Philistines came to her; and they said to her, Entice him, and find out how it is that his strength is so great, and how we can prevail against him and bind him so that we may afflict him; and we each will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.</td></tr>

And there was an ambush staying in the inner chamber. But he broke them off his arms like a thread.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>16:13</a></td><td class=td>大利拉对参孙说，你到如今还是欺哄我，向我说谎；你告诉我，当用何法才能捆绑你。参孙对她说，你若将我头上的七条发绺，与纬线同织，用橛子钉在墙上，我就软弱像别人一样。<br>Then Delilah said to Samson, Until now you have mocked me and told me lies; tell me how you can be bound. And he said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web  and fasten them with the pin onto the wall, I will become weak and be like any other man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>16:14</a></td><td class=td>于是大利拉趁参孙睡觉的时候，将他的七条发绺与纬线同织，用橛子钉住，对他说，参孙哪，非利士人来捉你了！参孙从睡中醒来，将机上的橛子和纬线一齐都拔出来了。<br>So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web; and she fastened them with the pin. Then she said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! And he awoke from his sleep and plucked up the pin of the loom and the web.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>16:15</a></td><td class=td>大利拉对参孙说，你的心既不在我这里，怎么说你爱我呢？你这三次欺哄我，没有告诉我，你为何有这么大的力气。<br>Then she said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart is not with me? These three times you have mocked me and have not told me how it is that your strength is so great.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>16:16</a></td><td class=td>大利拉天天用话催逼他，甚至他魂里烦得要死。<br>And after she pressed him with her words every day and urged him, his soul was tired to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>16:17</a></td><td class=td>参孙就把心中的一切都告诉了她，对她说，向来人没有用剃刀剃我的头，因为我从母腹里就归神作拿细耳人；若剃了我的头发，我的力气就离开我，我便软弱像所有的人一样。<br>And he told her all his heart and said to her, No razor has ever come upon my head, for I have been a Nazarite to God from my mother's womb. If I were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become weak and be like all men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>16:18</a></td><td class=td>大利拉见他把心中的一切都告诉了她，就打发人去召请非利士人的首领，说，他已经把心中的一切都告诉了我，请你们再上来一次。于是非利士人的首领手里拿着银子，上到妇人那里。<br>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent word and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up once more, for he has told me all his heart.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>16:19</a></td><td class=td>大利拉使参孙枕着她的膝睡觉，叫了一个人来，把参孙头上的七条发绺都剃除。于是大利拉起首克制他，他的力气离开了他。<br>And she put him to sleep in her lap and called for a man; and she shaved off the seven locks of his head. And she began to afflict him, and his strength left  him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>16:20</a></td><td class=td>大利拉说，参孙哪，非利士人来捉你了！参孙从睡中醒来，心里说，我要像前几次出去，抖动脱身；他却不知道耶和华已经离开他了。<br>Then she said, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! And he awoke from his sleep and said, I will go out as at other times and shake myself free. But he did not know that Jehovah had left  him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>16:21</a></td><td class=td>非利士人将他拿住，剜了他的眼睛，带他下到迦萨，用铜炼拘索他；他就在监里推磨。<br>And the Philistines grabbed him and gouged out his eyes. And they took him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze fetters; and he ground at the mill in the prison house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>16:22</a></td><td class=td>然而他的头发被剃之后，又开始长起来了。<br>But the hair on his head began to grow back after it had been shaved off.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>16:23</a></td><td class=td>非利士人的首领聚集，要给他们的神大衮献大祭，并且欢乐；他们说，我们的神将我们的仇敌参孙交在我们手中了。<br>And the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>16:24</a></td><td class=td>众人看见参孙，就赞美他们的神说，我们的神将毁坏我们的地，且杀害我们许多人的仇敌交在我们手中了。<br>And when the people saw him they praised their god, for they said, Our god has delivered our enemy into our hand, even him who desolated our land, who slew many of us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>16:25</a></td><td class=td>他们心里正高兴的时候，就说，叫参孙来，在我们面前戏耍戏耍。于是将参孙从监里叫出来，他就在众人面前戏耍。他们使他站在两柱中间。<br>And when their hearts were merry, they said, Call for Samson, that he may entertain us. So they called for Samson from the prison house, and he performed before them. Then they made him stand between the pillars.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>16:26</a></td><td class=td>参孙向拉他手的少年人说，求你让我摸着托房的柱子，我要靠一靠。<br>And Samson said to the youth who held him by his hand, Let me feel the pillars upon which the house rests, that I may rest against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>16:27</a></td><td class=td>那时房内充满男女，非利士人的众首领也都在那里；房的平顶上约有三千男女观看参孙戏耍。<br>Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and on the roof there were about three thousand men and women, who were looking on while Samson performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>16:28</a></td><td class=td>参孙呼求耶和华说，主耶和华阿，求你记念我。神阿，求你赐我力量，就只这一次，使我在非利士人身上一次报那剜我双眼的仇。<br>And Samson called on Jehovah and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray; and strengthen me, I pray, this one time only, O God, that I may be avenged of the Philistines at once for my two eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>16:29</a></td><td class=td>参孙就抱住托房的那两根中间的柱子，右手一根，左手一根，并且靠着柱子，<br>And Samson grasped the two middle pillars upon which the house rested and leaned against them, one with his right hand and the other with his left.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>16:30</a></td><td class=td>说，我情愿与非利士人同死。他尽力屈身，房子就倒塌，压住首领和房内的众人。这样，参孙死的时候所杀的人，比活着时所杀的还多。<br>And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed with all his strength, and the house fell upon the lords and all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed in his death were more than those that he killed in his life.</td></tr>
