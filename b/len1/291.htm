<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>24:3</a></td><td class=td>约押对王说，无论百姓有多少，愿耶和华你的神再加增百倍，使我主我王亲眼得见。我主我王何必喜悦行这事呢？<br>And Joab said to the king, Now may Jehovah your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king may see  it. But why does my lord the king desire this thing?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>24:13</a></td><td class=td>于是迦得来见大卫，把这些灾告诉他，对他说，你愿意在你的地上有七年的饥荒临到呢？是你在敌人面前逃跑，被追赶三个月呢？是在你的地上有三日的瘟疫呢？现在你要思想，看看我该用什么话回覆那差我来的。<br>So Gad went to David and told him  these things. And he said to him, Shall seven years of famine come upon you in your land? Or shall you flee before your adversaries for three months while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of pestilence in your land? Consider now and see what word I should return to Him who sent me.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>24:15</a></td><td class=td>于是，耶和华降瘟疫于以色列，自早晨到所定的时候；从但直到别是巴，百姓中死了七万人。<br>So Jehovah sent a pestilence in Israel from the morning until the appointed time; and seventy thousand people died among the people from Dan to Beer-sheba.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>24:16</a></td><td class=td>天使向耶路撒冷伸手要灭城的时候，耶和华就后悔不降这灾；祂对灭民的天使说，够了，现在住手罢。那时，耶和华的使者在耶布斯人亚劳拿的禾场附近。<br>And when the angel stretched forth his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented of the harm. And He said to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough; now hold back your hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>24:17</a></td><td class=td>大卫看见那击杀百姓的天使，就对耶和华说，是我犯了罪，是我行了恶；但这群羊作了什么呢？愿你的手攻击我和我的父家。<br>And David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the angel striking the people and said, It is I who have sinned, and it is I who have acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against the house of my father.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>24:21</a></td><td class=td>说，我主我王为何来到仆人这里呢？大卫说，我要向你买这禾场，为耶和华筑一座坛，使百姓中的灾疫止住。<br>And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing floor from you to build an altar to Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed among the people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>24:22</a></td><td class=td>亚劳拿对大卫说，我主我王看什么为好，就拿去献上罢。看哪，这里有牛可以作燔祭，有打粮的器具和套牛的轭可以当柴烧。<br>And Araunah said to David, May my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good in his sight. Look, the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing instruments and the yokes for the oxen for the wood -</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>24:24</a></td><td class=td>王对亚劳拿说，不然；我必按着价值向你买，我不愿用白得之物作燔祭献给耶和华我的神。大卫就用五十舍客勒银子买了那禾场与牛。<br>But the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy  it from you for a price, and I will not offer to Jehovah my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>24:25</a></td><td class=td>大卫在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，献燔祭和平安祭。如此，耶和华应允国民为那地所恳求的，灾疫在以色列人中就止住了。<br>And there David built an altar to Jehovah, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And Jehovah responded to the entreaty for the land, and the plague was stayed in Israel.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
