If Jehovah is God, follow Him; but if Baal is, follow him. And the people did not answer him a word.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>18:23</a></td><td class=td>当给我们两只公牛，巴力的申言者可以挑选一只，切成块子放在柴上，不要点火；<br>Let them therefore give us two bulls.

And call on the name of your god, but apply no fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>18:26</a></td><td class=td>他们将所给他们的公牛豫备好了，从早晨到午间，呼求巴力的名，说，巴力阿，求你回应我们！却没有声音，没有回应的。他们在所筑的坛四围踊跳。<br>So they took the bull which had been given them and prepared it; and they called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, O Baal, answer us! But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they leaped around the altar that had been made.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>18:27</a></td><td class=td>到了正午，以利亚嬉笑他们，说，大声呼求罢，因为他是神；他或在默想，或走到一边，或在行路。他或在睡觉，就要醒来。<br>Then at noon Elijah mocked them and said, Cry out with a loud voice, for he is a god; for he is meditating or has wandered off or is on a journey. Perhaps he is asleep and will awake.</td></tr>
