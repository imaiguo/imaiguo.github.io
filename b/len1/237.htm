<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>1:2</a></td><td class=td>他有两个妻子，一个名叫哈拿，一个名叫毗尼拿。毗尼拿有孩子，哈拿却没有孩子。<br>And he had two wives; the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>1:3</a></td><td class=td>这人每年从本城上示罗去敬拜，并献祭给万军之耶和华；在那里有以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈，作耶和华的祭司。<br>And this man went up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests of Jehovah, were there.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>1:5</a></td><td class=td>但他给哈拿的分却是双倍的，因为他爱哈拿。无奈耶和华使哈拿不能生育。<br>But he would give a double portion to Hannah, for it was Hannah whom he loved; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>1:13</a></td><td class=td>原来哈拿心中诉说，只动嘴唇，听不见声音，因此以利以为她喝醉了。<br>And Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought that she was drunk.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>1:15</a></td><td class=td>哈拿回答说，我主阿，不是这样。我是灵里受压的妇人，淡酒浓酒都没有喝，但在耶和华面前倾心吐意。<br>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord. I am a woman oppressed in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>1:16</a></td><td class=td>不要将婢女看作卑劣的女子。我因被人激动，愁苦太重，所以一直诉说到如今。<br>Do not take your female servant for a worthless woman; for out of the greatness of my anxiety and provocation I have been speaking all this time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>1:17</a></td><td class=td>以利回答说，你平平安安的去罢，愿以色列的神将你向祂所求的赐给你。<br>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have requested from Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>1:18</a></td><td class=td>哈拿说，愿婢女在你眼前蒙恩。于是妇人回去，并且吃饭，面上不再带愁容了。<br>And she said, Let your servant find favor in your sight. And the woman went her way; and she ate, and her countenance was  sad no more.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>1:19</a></td><td class=td>次日，他们清早起来，在耶和华面前敬拜，就回拉玛，到了家里。以利加拿和妻子哈拿同房；耶和华记念哈拿。<br>And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah; and they returned and came to their house in Ramah.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>1:21</a></td><td class=td>以利加拿和他全家都上示罗去，要向耶和华献年祭，并还所许的愿。<br>And the man Elkanah went up with all his house to offer the yearly sacrifice to Jehovah and his vow.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>1:22</a></td><td class=td>哈拿却没有上去；她对丈夫说，等孩子断了奶，我便带他上去，让他朝见耶和华，并且永远住在那里。<br>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, When the child is weaned, then I will bring him up, so that he may appear before Jehovah and stay there forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>1:23</a></td><td class=td>她丈夫以利加拿对她说，你看怎样好，就怎样行罢；可以留在家里，等到你给孩子断了奶。但愿耶和华使祂的话坚立。于是妇人留在家里乳养儿子，直到给他断了奶。<br>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in your sight; stay until you have weaned him. Only, may Jehovah establish His word. So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>1:24</a></td><td class=td>她既给孩子断了奶，就带他一同上去，又带了三只公牛，一伊法细面，一皮袋酒；孩子还小，她就带他到示罗耶和华的殿中。<br>And as soon as she weaned him, she brought him up with her, along with three bulls and one ephah of flour and a skin of wine; and she brought him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh, although the child was young.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>1:25</a></td><td class=td>他们宰了一只公牛，就领孩子到以利那里。<br>And they slaughtered the bull and brought the child to Eli.</td></tr>
