<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>5:1</a></td><td class=td>我要歌唱我所亲爱的，唱我所爱者的歌，论到祂的葡萄园。我所亲爱的有葡萄园，在肥美的山冈上。<br>Let me sing of my Beloved, A song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. My Beloved had a vineyard On a fertile hill.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>祂刨挖园子，清除石头，栽种上等的葡萄树，又在园中盖了一座楼，凿出压酒池；指望结好葡萄，反倒结了野葡萄。<br>And He dug it up and cleared away its stones, And He planted it with the choicest vine. Then He built a tower in the middle of it, And hewed out a wine vat in it. And He looked for it to produce grapes, But it produced only wild grapes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>耶路撒冷的居民和犹大人哪，请你们现今在我与我的葡萄园之间，作个评断。<br>So then, you inhabitants of Jerusalem And you men of Judah, Judge between Me And My vineyard.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>我为我的葡萄园，还可以作什么，是我没有作过的呢？我指望结好葡萄，怎么倒结了野葡萄呢？<br>What more could I have done for My vineyard That I have not already done for  it? Why then, when I looked for it to produce grapes, Did it produce only wild grapes?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>现在我告诉你们，我要向我的葡萄园怎样行：我必撤去它的篱笆，使它被吞灭；拆毁它的墙垣，使它被践踏。<br>And now I will make known to you What I will now do to My vineyard: I will remove its hedge, and it will be consumed; I will break down its wall, and it will become a trampled place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>我必使它荒废，不再修理，不再锄刨；荆棘蒺藜倒要生长。我也必命云不降雨在其上。<br>And I will make it a waste; It will not be pruned, nor will it be hoed; But thorns and thistles will come on it. And I will command the clouds Not to rain upon it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>原来万军之耶和华的葡萄园就是以色列家，祂所喜悦的树就是犹大人；祂指望的是公平，谁知倒有流血！指望的是公义，谁知倒有哀声！<br>For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, And the men of Judah, the plant of His good pleasure; And He expected justice, but instead, bloodshed! He expected righteousness, but instead, an outcry of distress!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>5:8</a></td><td class=td>祸哉，那些以房接房，以地连地，以致不留余地，只顾自己独居境内的人！<br>Woe to those who join house to house, Who lay field to field, Till there is no place left, And you dwell alone in the midst of the land!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>我耳闻万军之耶和华起誓说，必有许多房屋成为荒凉，又大又美的房屋无人居住。<br>In my ears Jehovah of hosts has  sworn: Many houses shall indeed become desolate; Great ones and fine ones shall be without inhabitants.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>因为十亩葡萄园只出一罢特酒，一贺梅珥谷种只结一伊法粮食。<br>For ten acres of vineyard will produce a mere bath of wine, And a homer of seed will produce an ephah of grain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>5:11</a></td><td class=td>祸哉，那些清早起来追求浓酒，留连到夜深，以致因酒发烧的人！<br>Woe to those who rise early in the morning That they may run after liquor, To those who linger into the  evening That wine may inflame them!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>5:12</a></td><td class=td>他们在筵席上弹琴、鼓瑟、击鼓、吹笛、饮酒，却不顾念耶和华的作为，也不留心祂手所作的。<br>Lyre and harp, tambourine and  flute, And wine are the essence of their banquets; And they do not consider what has been done by Jehovah, Nor do they regard the work of His hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>5:13</a></td><td class=td>所以我的百姓因无知就被迁徙；他们的尊贵人成了饥饿的民，群众极其干渴。<br>Hence, my people go into exile For lack of knowledge; Their nobility become famished  men, And their multitudes, parched with thirst.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>5:14</a></td><td class=td>故此，阴间扩张其欲，大开其口，没有限量；耶路撒冷的荣美、群众、喧哗、并在其中欢乐的人，都落入阴间。<br>Hence, Sheol enlarges its appetite And opens its mouth wide, without limit, And Jerusalem's splendor descends, and her din And her uproar and the jubilant within her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>5:15</a></td><td class=td>平常人屈服，显贵人降为卑，高傲人的眼目也降为卑；<br>Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased; And the eyes of the haughty are abased;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>惟有万军之耶和华，因审判得高举，圣别的神，因公义显为圣别。<br>But Jehovah of hosts is exalted in judgment, And the holy God shows Himself holy in righteousness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>5:17</a></td><td class=td>那时羊羔必来吃草，如同在自己的草场，丰肥人的荒场必被外人吃尽。<br>Then lambs will graze there as in their pasture, And strangers will eat the wastelands of fat men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>5:18</a></td><td class=td>祸哉，那些以虚假之绳索牵罪孽，又像以套绳拉罪恶的人！<br>Woe to those who draw iniquity with ropes of vanity, And sin as with cart ropes;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>5:19</a></td><td class=td>他们说，任祂急速而行，赶快成就祂的作为，使我们可以看见；任以色列圣者所谋画的临近成就，使我们可以知道。<br>Who say, He should hurry up; He should hasten His work, So that we may see it; And the counsel of the Holy One of Israel Should draw near and happen, So that we may know it!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>5:20</a></td><td class=td>祸哉，那些称恶为善，称善为恶，以暗为光，以光为暗，以苦为甜，以甜为苦的人！<br>Woe to those who call evil good, And good evil; Who put darkness for light, And light for darkness; Who put bitter for sweet, And sweet for bitter!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>5:21</a></td><td class=td>祸哉，那些自视为有智慧，自看为精明的人！<br>Isaiah 5:21 says, "Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, And prudent in their own sight!"</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>5:22</a></td><td class=td>祸哉，那些饮酒的勇士，那些调浓酒的壮士！<br>Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine, And men of valor in mixing  liquor;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>5:23</a></td><td class=td>他们因受贿赂，就定恶人为义，将义人的义夺去。<br>Who acquit the criminal as a result of a bribe, But refuse righteousness to the righteous!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>5:24</a></td><td class=td>火舌怎样吞灭碎秸，干草怎样落在火焰之中，照样，他们的根必像朽物，他们的花必像灰尘飞扬；因为他们厌弃万军之耶和华的训诲，藐视以色列圣者的言语。<br>Therefore as a tongue of fire consumes the stubble, And the chaff sinks in flames, Their root will be like decay, And their bud will disappear like dust; For they have rejected the instruction of Jehovah of hosts And despised the speaking of the Holy One of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>5:25</a></td><td class=td>所以耶和华的怒气向祂的百姓发作，祂的手伸出击打他们。山岭震动，他们的尸首在街市上好像粪土。虽然如此，祂的怒气还未转消，祂的手仍然伸出。<br>For this reason the anger of Jehovah burns against His people, And He stretches out His hand over them and strikes them. And the mountains quake, and their corpses are Like garbage in the middle of the street. In spite of all this His anger is not turned away; Rather, His hand is still stretched out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>5:26</a></td><td class=td>祂必高举旌旗，招远方的国民，发啸声叫他们从地极而来；他们必急速奔来。<br>He also lifts up a standard to a distant nation, And whistles to it from the ends of the earth; And indeed it comes with swift speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>5:27</a></td><td class=td>他们中间没有疲倦的、绊跌的，没有打盹的、睡觉的；他们的腰带并不放松，鞋带也不折断。<br>None of them is weary, and none stumbles among them; No one slumbers or sleeps; And their belts are not loosened at their waists, Nor are their sandal thongs broken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>5:28</a></td><td class=td>他们的箭快利，弓也上了弦；马蹄算如坚石，车轮好像旋风。<br>The arrows of these are  sharpened, And all their bows are drawn; The hooves of their horses are considered to be like flint, And their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>5:29</a></td><td class=td>他们要吼叫像狮子，咆哮像少壮狮子；他们要咆哮抓食，安然叼去，无人搭救。<br>Their roar is like a lion's, And they roar like young lions; When they growl and seize prey, They carry it away safe, and there is none to rescue it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>5:30</a></td><td class=td>那日他们要向以色列人吼叫，像海浪匉訇。人若望地，只见黑暗艰难，亮光在云中变为昏暗。<br>And they will growl over it in that day, Like the roaring of the sea. When one will look upon the land, indeed, there will be darkness and distress, And the light will be darkened with its clouds.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
