<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>6:3</a></td><td class=td>彼此呼喊说，圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，万军之耶和华；祂的荣光充满全地。<br>And one called to the other, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; The whole earth is filled with His glory.</td></tr>

For I am a man of unclean lips, And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell; Yet my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>6:8</a></td><td class=td>我又听见主的声音，说，我可以差遣谁呢？谁肯为我们去呢？我说，我在这里，请差遣我。<br>Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us? And I said, Here am I; send me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>6:9</a></td><td class=td>祂说，你去对这百姓说，你们听是要听见，却绝不领悟；看是要看见，却绝不晓得。<br>And He said to me, Go and say to this people, Hear indeed, but do not perceive; And see indeed, but do not understand.</td></tr>
