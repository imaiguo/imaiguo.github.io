<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>12:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和华差遣拿单去见大卫。拿单到了大卫那里，对他说，在一座城里有两个人，一个是富户，一个是穷人。<br>Then Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he went to him and said to him, Two men lived in a city, one rich and the other poor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>12:2</a></td><td class=td>富户有许多羊群牛群；<br>The rich man had very many flocks and herds,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>12:3</a></td><td class=td>穷人除了所买来养活的一只小母羊羔之外，别无所有。羊羔在他和他儿女身边长大，吃他那一点的食物，喝他杯中所有的，睡在他怀中，对于他如同女儿一样。<br>But the poor man had nothing but one small ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he nourished it, and it grew up together with him and his children; it ate of the morsels of his food and drank out of his own cup and lay on his bosom; indeed it was like a daughter to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>12:4</a></td><td class=td>有一旅客来到富户那里；富户舍不得从自己的羊群牛群中取一只豫备给过路的客人吃，却取了那穷人的羊羔，豫备给到他那里的人吃。<br>And there came a traveler to the rich man. But the rich man refused to take  something from his own flock and herd to dress for the wayfarer who had come to him; but he took the poor man's ewe lamb and dressed it for the man who had come to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>12:5</a></td><td class=td>大卫就甚恼怒那人，对拿单说，我指着永活的耶和华起誓，行这事的人该死；<br>And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man. And he said to Nathan, As Jehovah lives, the man who has done this is worthy of death;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>12:6</a></td><td class=td>他必偿还羊羔四倍，因为他行了这事，又因为他没有怜恤的心。<br>And he shall restore the ewe lamb fourfold because he has done this thing and because he had no pity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>12:7</a></td><td class=td>拿单对大卫说，你就是那人。耶和华以色列的神如此说，我膏你作以色列的王，救你脱离扫罗的手；<br>Then Nathan said to David, You are the man. Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>12:8</a></td><td class=td>我将你主人的家业赐给你，将你主人的妻妾交在你怀里，又将以色列和犹大家赐给你；这若是太少，还可以多多的加给你。<br>And I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your bosom, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and if this were too little, I would have added to you such and such things.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>12:9</a></td><td class=td>你为什么藐视耶和华的话，行祂眼中看为恶的事？你用刀击杀赫人乌利亚，又娶了他的妻子作你的妻子；你是借亚扪人的刀杀了他。<br>Why have you despised the word of Jehovah by doing what is evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife as your wife and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>12:13</a></td><td class=td>大卫对拿单说，我得罪耶和华了。拿单说，耶和华已经除掉你的罪，你必不至于死。<br>And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David, Jehovah has also put away your sin; you will not die.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>12:14</a></td><td class=td>只是你因着行这事，叫耶和华的仇敌大得亵渎的机会，故此，你所得的儿子必定要死。<br>Nevertheless, because you have given the enemies of Jehovah much occasion to blaspheme  Him because of this thing, the son who is born to you shall also surely die.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>12:15</a></td><td class=td>拿单就回家去了。耶和华击打乌利亚妻子给大卫所生的孩子，他就得了重病。<br>Then Nathan went to his house. And Jehovah struck the child whom Uriah's wife bore to David, and he was very sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>12:16</a></td><td class=td>大卫为这孩子恳求神，而且禁食，进入内室，终夜躺在地上。<br>And David besought God for the child; and David fasted and went in and spent all night lying on the ground.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>12:18</a></td><td class=td>到第七日，孩子死了。大卫的臣仆不敢告诉他孩子死了，因他们说，看哪，0孩子还活着的时候，我们对他说话，他尚且不肯听；我们怎能告诉他孩子死了？他可能会伤害自己。<br>And on the seventh day the child died. And David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, While the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to our voice; how then can we tell him that the child is dead? He will do  himself some harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>12:19</a></td><td class=td>大卫见臣仆彼此低声说话，就知道孩子死了。他对臣仆说，孩子死了么？他们说，死了。<br>And David saw that his servants were whispering, and David perceived that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said,  He is dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>12:20</a></td><td class=td>大卫就从地上起来，沐浴，抹膏，换了衣裳，进耶和华的殿敬拜；然后回宫，要人摆饭，他便吃了。<br>Then David rose up from the ground and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went to the house of Jehovah and worshipped. Then he went to his house; and when he requested  it, they set food before him, and he ate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>12:21</a></td><td class=td>臣仆对他说，你所行的这事，是什么意思？孩子活着的时候，你禁食哭泣；孩子死了，你倒起来吃饭。<br>And his servants said to him, What is this thing that you have done? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept; but as soon as the child died, you rose up and ate bread.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>12:22</a></td><td class=td>大卫说，孩子还活着，我禁食哭泣；因为我想，谁知道呢？或许耶和华施恩与我，使孩子得以存活。<br>And he said, While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, Who knows? Jehovah may be gracious to me, and the child may live.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>12:23</a></td><td class=td>如今孩子死了，我何必禁食？我岂能使他返回？我必往他那里去，他却不能回我这里来。<br>But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not come back to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>12:24</a></td><td class=td>大卫安慰他的妻子拔示巴，进到她那里去，与她同寝，她就生了一个儿子，大卫给他起名叫所罗门。耶和华喜爱他，<br>And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her. And she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>12:25</a></td><td class=td>就差遣申言者拿单，为耶和华的缘故给他起名叫耶底底亚。<br>And He sent  word through Nathan the prophet and called his name Jedidiah for Jehovah's sake.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>12:26</a></td><td class=td>约押攻打亚扪人的拉巴，取了那京城。<br>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon and took the royal city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>12:27</a></td><td class=td>约押打发使者去见大卫，说，我攻打拉巴，取了水城。<br>And Joab sent messengers to David and said, I have fought against Rabbah; indeed I have taken the city of water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>12:28</a></td><td class=td>现在你要聚集其余的军兵来，安营围攻这城，取下这城；免得我取了这城，人就以我的名叫这城。<br>Now therefore gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and take it; otherwise I myself will take the city, and it will be called by my name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>12:29</a></td><td class=td>于是大卫聚集众军，往拉巴去攻城，就取了这城，<br>So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>12:30</a></td><td class=td>夺了亚扪人之王头上的金冠冕；其上的金子重一他连得，且嵌着宝石。人将这冠冕戴在大卫头上。大卫带走了从城里所夺的许多财物，<br>And he took the crown of their king from off his head. And the weight of it was a talent of gold, and it had precious stones; and it was put upon David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>12:31</a></td><td class=td>又将城里的人拉出来，放在锯下，或铁耙下，或铁斧下，或叫他经过砖窑；大卫待亚扪人的各城都是如此。其后，大卫和众人都回耶路撒冷去了。<br>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them under saws and iron cutting tools and iron axes and made them pass through the brick kilns; and thus did he do to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
