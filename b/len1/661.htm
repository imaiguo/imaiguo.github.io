<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>我心里说，来罢，我要试一试享乐，好享美福！谁知，这也是虚空。<br>I said in my heart, Come now, I will test out pleasure; so  taste enjoyment. But indeed, this also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>我指嬉笑说，这是狂妄；论享乐说，这有何功效呢？<br>I said of laughter, Madness! and of pleasure, What does it accomplish?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>我心里查究，如何用酒使我肉体舒畅，我心却仍以智慧引导我；又如何持住愚昧，等我看明，世人在天下一生有数的日子中所作的，有何好处。<br>I searched with my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine while my heart guided me with wisdom, and how to take hold of folly, until I could see what good there is for the children of men to do under the heavens the few days of their lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>我为自己动大工程，建造房屋，栽种葡萄园，<br>I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>修造园囿，在其中栽种各样果树；<br>I made gardens and parks for myself, and planted in them trees of every kind of fruit.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>挖造水池，用以浇灌生长的林木。<br>I made water ponds for myself from which to water a forest of growing trees.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>我买了仆婢，也有生在家中的奴仆；又拥有许多的牛群羊群，胜过以前在耶路撒冷的众人。<br>I bought male and female servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than all that had been before me in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>我又为自己积蓄金银，和君王并各省的财宝；又得唱歌的男女，和世人所喜爱的物，并许多的妃嫔。<br>I gathered also silver and gold for myself and the treasures of kings and provinces; I got for myself male singers and female singers and the delights of the children of men,  concubine after concubine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>这样，我就日见昌大，胜过以前在耶路撒冷的众人；我的智慧仍然存留。<br>And I became great and increased more than all who had been before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>凡我眼所要的，我没有不给的；我不禁止我的心有任何的享乐；因我的心在我一切劳碌中得了快乐，这就是我从一切劳碌中所得的分。<br>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not keep my heart from any pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>后来，我转看我手所作的一切工，和我工作中的劳碌；谁知都是虚空，都是捕风；在日光之下毫无益处。<br>Then I turned to all the works that my hands had done and the labor by which I had labored in doing them, and indeed, all was vanity and a chasing after wind; and there was no advantage under the sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>我转看智慧、狂妄和愚昧。在王以后来的人还能作什么呢？也不过作早先所作的就是了。<br>And I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly, for what will the man do who comes after the king? Only that which has been done already.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>我便看出智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗。<br>And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>智慧人的眼目光明，愚昧人在黑暗里行；但我也看明，这两等人所遭遇的都是一样。<br>The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness; yet I also perceived that one fate happens to them all.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>我就心里说，愚昧人所遭遇的，我也必遭遇。既是这样，我为何更有智慧呢？我心里说，这也是虚空。<br>And I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so also will it happen to me. Why then have I been so wise? And I said in my heart, This also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>智慧人和愚昧人一样，永远无人记念，因为日后都要被遗忘；可叹智慧人死亡，与愚昧人无异！<br>For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance forever, seeing that in the days to come all will be forgotten. And how the wise man dies just like the fool!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>所以我恨恶生命，因为在日光之下所作的工，我都以为烦恼；一切都是虚空，都是捕风。<br>So I hated life, for the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me, because everything is vanity and a chasing after wind.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>我恨恶一切的劳碌，就是我在日光之下的劳碌，因为我所得的都必留给我以后的人。<br>And I hated all my labor for which I had labored under the sun, because I will leave it to the man who comes after me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>那人是智慧是愚昧，谁能知道？他竟要管理我劳碌所得的一切，就是我在日光之下用智慧所得的。这也是虚空。<br>And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will be master over all my labor for which I have labored and in which I exercised wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>故此，我转想我在日光之下劳碌所得的一切，心便绝望。<br>Therefore I turned and gave my heart up to despair of all the labor for which I had labored under the sun;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>因为有人用智慧、知识、技能所劳碌得来的，却要留给未曾劳碌的人为分。这也是虚空，也是大患。<br>For there is a man whose labor has been with wisdom and with knowledge and with skill, and to a man who has not labored on it he gives it as his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>人在日光之下劳碌操心，在他一切的劳碌上得着什么呢？<br>For what will a man have with all his labor and with the striving of his heart by which he labors under the sun?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>因为他一生的日子都是忧伤，他的辛劳成为愁烦，连夜间心也不安息。这也是虚空。<br>For all his days are sorrow, and his travail is vexation; even at night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>2:24</a></td><td class=td>人莫强如吃喝，且让自己在劳碌中享美福。我看这也是出于神的手。<br>There is nothing better for man than to eat and to drink and to make his soul taste enjoyment in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>2:25</a></td><td class=td>因为离了祂，谁能吃用、享受呢？<br>For who can eat or who can enjoy  without Him?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>2:26</a></td><td class=td>神看谁为好，就给谁智慧、知识和喜乐；却将辛劳给罪人，叫他将所收聚的、所堆积的，归给神看为好的人。这也是虚空，也是捕风。<br>For to the man who is good in His sight He gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He gives the travail of gathering and heaping up that it may be given to him who is good in God's sight. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
