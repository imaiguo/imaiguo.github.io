<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>你们要对你们的弟兄说，阿米；要对你们的姊妹说，路哈玛。<br>Say to your brothers, Ammi, And to your sisters, Ruhamah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>你们要与你们的母亲大大争辩，因为她不是我的妻子，我也不是她的丈夫；叫她除掉脸上的淫乱，和胸间的奸淫，<br>Contend with your mother; contend. For she is not my wife, And I am not her husband. And let her turn away her harlotries from her face, And her adulteries from between her breasts,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>免得我剥去她的衣服，使她赤身像才生的日子一样，使她如旷野，如干旱之地，以干渴杀死她。<br>Lest I strip her naked And set her out as in the day she was born And make her a wilderness And make her a dry land And slay her with thirst.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>我必不怜恤她的儿女，因为他们是从淫乱生的儿女。<br>And on her children I will not have compassion, For they are the children of  harlotries.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>他们的母亲行了淫乱，怀他们的母作了可羞耻的事，因为她说，我要随从所爱的人，他们给我饼和水，羊毛和麻，油和酒。<br>For their mother has gone about as a harlot; She who conceived them has acted shamefully; For she has said, I will go after my lovers, Who give me my bread and my  water, My wool and my flax, My oil and my drink.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>因此，我必用荆棘堵塞她的道，筑墙挡住她，使她找不着路。<br>Therefore I will now hedge up  Her way with thorns; And I will build up a wall against her, So that she will not find her paths.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>她必追随所爱的人，却追不上，她必寻找他们，却寻不见；便说，我要归回前夫，因我那时的光景比如今还好。<br>And she will pursue her lovers But will not overtake them; And she will seek them but not find them; And she will say, I will go And return to my first husband, For it was better for me then than now.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>她不知道是我给她五谷、新酒和新油；又加增她的金银；他们却用于巴力。<br>For she did not know That it was I who gave her The grain and the new wine and the fresh oil, And who multiplied to her silver And gold, which they  used for Baal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>因此到了收割的时候，出酒的季节，我必将我的五谷新酒收回，也必将她应当遮体的羊毛和麻夺去。<br>Therefore I will  take back My grain in its time And My new wine in its appointed season, And I will snatch away My wool and My flax, Which were to cover her  nakedness.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>我必使她一切的欢乐，她的节期、月朔、安息日、并她所定一切的会，都止息了。<br>And I will bring all her mirth to an end, Her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, And all her appointed assemblies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>我也必使她的葡萄树和无花果树荒芜，就是她说，这是我所爱的人给我为代价的；我必使这些树变为丛林，为田野的走兽所吃。<br>And I will desolate her vine and her fig tree, Of which she said, These are my payments That my lovers have given me; And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field will devour them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>我必在她身上追讨她素日给诸巴力烧香的罪，那时她佩带鼻环和珠宝，随从她所爱的人，却忘记了我；这是耶和华说的。<br>And I will visit the days of the Baals upon her,  In which she offered incense to them And adorned herself with her nose rings and her jewels And went after her lovers And forgot Me, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>因此我必诱导她，领她到旷野，对她的心说话；<br>Therefore I am now luring her, And I will bring her into the wilderness And will speak to her heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>从那里我必赐她葡萄园，又赐她亚割谷作为指望的门；她必在那里应声，与她幼年的日子一样，与她从埃及地上来的日子相同。<br>And I will give her her vineyards from there And the valley of Achor as a door of hope; And she will respond there as in the days of her youth And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和华说，那日你必称呼我：我的丈夫，不再称呼我：巴力。<br>And in that day, declares Jehovah, You will call Me My Husband And will no longer call Me Baali.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>因为我必从她口中除掉诸巴力的名号，他们的名号不再被记念。<br>For I will take away the names of the Baals from her mouth, And they will no longer be  remembered by their name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>当那日我必为我的民，与田野的走兽、空中的飞鸟、并地上的爬物立约；又必从那地折断弓刀，止息争战，使他们安然躺卧。<br>And I will make a covenant for them In that day With the beasts of the field And with the birds of heaven And the creeping things of the  earth; And bow and sword and battle I will break from the land, And I will cause them to lie down in safety.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>我必聘你永远归我为妻，以公义和公平，以慈爱和怜恤聘你归我；<br>And I will betroth you to Myself forever; Indeed I will betroth you to Myself In righteousness and justice And in lovingkindness and compassions;</td></tr>
