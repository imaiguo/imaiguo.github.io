<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>24:2</a></td><td class=td>扫罗就从全以色列中选取三千精兵，率领他们往野羊的磐石一带去，寻索大卫和跟随他的人。<br>And Saul took three thousand choice men from all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the Rocks of the Wild Goats.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>24:3</a></td><td class=td>到了路旁的羊圈，在那里有洞，扫罗进去大解。大卫和跟随他的人正坐在洞里的深处。<br>And he came to the sheepfolds along the way, and a cave was there. And Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost part of the cave.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>24:4</a></td><td class=td>跟随大卫的人对他说，耶和华曾对你说，我要将你的仇敌交在你手里，你可以照你看为好的待他；如今那日子到了。大卫就起来，悄悄的割下扫罗外袍的衣边。<br>And David's men said to him, The day is here of which Jehovah said to you, I am about to give your enemy into your hand. Do then to him according to what seems good in your sight. So David rose up and cut off a corner of Saul's cloak without being noticed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>24:5</a></td><td class=td>随后大卫心中自责，因为割下扫罗的衣边；<br>But afterward David's heart smote him because he had cut off a corner of Saul's  cloak.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>24:8</a></td><td class=td>随后大卫也起来，从洞里出去，在扫罗后面呼叫说，我主，我王。扫罗往后观看，大卫就屈身，脸伏于地下拜。<br>Then David rose up afterward and came out of the cave.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>24:17</a></td><td class=td>对大卫说，你比我公义；因为你以善待我，我却以恶待你。<br>And he said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have repaid me with good, while I have repaid you with evil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>24:18</a></td><td class=td>你今日已表明你是如何以善待我；因为耶和华将我交在你手里，你却没有杀我。<br>And you have declared today how you did good to me, because Jehovah delivered me up into your hand, but you would not kill me.</td></tr>
