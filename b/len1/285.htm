And the king said to the people, I myself will surely go forth with you also.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>18:3</a></td><td class=td>百姓却说，你不可出战。若是我们逃跑，敌人必不介意；我们阵亡一半，敌人也不介意。但是你一人强似我们万人，所以你不如在城里帮助我们。<br>But the people said, You shall not go forth; for if we flee off, they will not care about us; and if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore it is better for you to be  available to help us from the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>18:4</a></td><td class=td>王向他们说，你们看怎么好，我就怎么行。于是王站在城门旁，众百姓百人一队或千人一队的出去了。<br>And the king said to them, What seems best in your sight I will do. So the king stood at the side of the gate, and all the people went forth by hundreds and by thousands.</td></tr>

And all the people heard when the king gave the command to all the captains concerning Absalom.</td></tr>

Why did you not strike him down to the ground there? For I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>18:12</a></td><td class=td>那人对约押说，我就是手中得你一千锭银子，也不敢伸手害王的儿子；因为我们听见王嘱咐你和亚比筛并以太，说，你们无论谁都要顾全那少年人押沙龙。<br>And the man said to Joab, Though I would receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I would not put forth my hand against the son of the king; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care of the young man Absalom, whoever  you be.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>18:18</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙活着的时候，在王谷为自己立了一根石柱，因他说，我没有儿子为我留名作记念。他就以自己的名称那石柱叫押沙龙记念碑，直到今日。<br>Now Absalom, while he was alive, had taken a pillar which was in the king's valley and raised  it up for himself, for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>18:21</a></td><td class=td>约押对古实人说，你去将你所看见的告诉王。古实人向约押下拜，就跑去了。<br>And Joab said to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen. And the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>18:22</a></td><td class=td>撒督的儿子亚希玛斯又对约押说，无论怎样，求你也让我随着古实人跑去。约押说，我儿，你报这信息，既不得赏赐，何必要跑去呢？<br>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?</td></tr>
