<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>12:16</a></td><td class=td>耶稣就告诉他们一个比喻，说，有一个财主的田地出产丰盛；<br>And He told them a parable, saying, The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>12:23</a></td><td class=td>因为生命胜于食物，身体胜于衣服。<br>For the life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. </td></tr>
