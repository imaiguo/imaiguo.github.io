But the Levites did not act quickly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>24:6</a></td><td class=td>于是王召了祭司长耶何耶大来，对他说，从前耶和华的仆人摩西，为见证的帐幕向以色列会众所规定的捐项，你为何不要求利未人，从犹大和耶路撒冷带来作修理殿的费用呢？<br>So the king called for Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, Why have you not required of the Levites to bring from Judah and from Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses the servant of Jehovah on the congregation of Israel for the Tent of Testimony?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>24:19</a></td><td class=td>但神仍遣申言者到他们那里，引导他们归向耶和华；这些申言者向他们作见证，他们却不肯听。<br>And He sent prophets to them to bring them back to Jehovah; and they testified to them, but they did not pay attention.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>24:20</a></td><td class=td>那时，神的灵披戴在祭司耶何耶大的儿子撒迦利亚身上，他就站在民以上，对他们说，神如此说，你们为何干犯耶和华的诫命，以致不得亨通呢？因为你们离弃耶和华，所以祂也离弃你们。<br>Then the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people and said to them, Thus says God, Why do you transgress the commandments of Jehovah, so that you do not prosper?

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>24:22</a></td><td class=td>这样，约阿施王不想念撒迦利亚的父亲耶何耶大向自己所施的恩慈，杀了他的儿子；撒迦利亚临死的时候说，愿耶和华鉴察伸冤！<br>Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had shown him, and he slew his son; and when he died he said, May Jehovah see and avenge!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>24:23</a></td><td class=td>次年岁首，亚兰人的军兵上来攻击约阿施，来到犹大和耶路撒冷，从民中杀了他们的众首领，将所掠的一切财货送到大马色王那里。<br>And at the turn of the year the army of the Syrians came up against him and came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>24:24</a></td><td class=td>亚兰人的军兵虽然只来了一小队，耶和华却将大队的军兵交在他们手里，是因犹大人离弃耶和华他们列祖的神，所以借亚兰人向约阿施执行惩罚。<br>Although the army of the Syrians had come with a small number of men, Jehovah delivered into their hand a very great army, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
