<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>13:1</a></td><td class=td>我又看见一个兽从海中上来，有十角七头，在十角上戴着十个冠冕，七头上有亵渎的名号。<br>And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names of blasphemy. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>13:2</a></td><td class=td>我所看见的兽，形状像豹，脚像熊的脚，口像狮子的口；那龙将自己的能力、座位和大权柄，都给了它。<br>And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>13:3</a></td><td class=td>兽的七头中，有一头似乎被杀至死，但那死伤却医好了。全地的人都希奇，就跟从那兽，<br>And one of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed. And the whole earth marveled after the beast. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>13:4</a></td><td class=td>又拜那龙，因为它将权柄给了兽；也拜兽说，谁能比这兽？谁能与它争战？<br>And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? And who can make war with him? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>13:5</a></td><td class=td>那龙又给它说夸大、亵渎话的口，并给它权柄，可以任意而行四十二个月。<br>And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>13:12</a></td><td class=td>它在头一个兽面前，施行头一个兽一切的权柄，并且叫地和住在地上的人，拜那死伤医好的头一个兽。<br>And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>13:14</a></td><td class=td>它因给它能力在兽面前所行的奇事，就迷惑住在地上的人，吩咐住在地上的人，给那受刀伤还活着的兽作个像。<br>And he deceives those who dwell on the earth on account of the signs which he was given power to do before the beast, commanding those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast, who had the stroke of the sword and revived. </td></tr>
