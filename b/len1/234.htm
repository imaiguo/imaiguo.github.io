And she said to her, Go, my daughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>路得就去了。她来到田间，在收割的人身后拾取麦穗，恰巧是在以利米勒家族的人波阿斯那块田里。<br>So she went. And she came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to glean in a portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from Elimelech's family.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>她起来又拾取麦穗，波阿斯吩咐仆人说，她就是在禾捆中拾取麦穗，也可以容她，不可羞辱她；<br>And when she rose up to glean, Boaz charged his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the standing grain, and do not reproach her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>并要从捆里抽出些来，留给她拾取，不可斥责她。<br>And also pull out some from the bundles for her, and leave it for her to glean; and do not rebuke her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>这样，路得在田间拾取麦穗，直到晚上；将所拾取的打了，约有一伊法大麦。<br>So she gleaned in the field until evening. And she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>她就把所拾取的带进城去给婆婆看，又把她吃饱了所剩的拿出来给婆婆。<br>And she took it up and went into the city. And her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned.  Ruth also brought out and gave to her what she had left after she had been earlier satisfied.</td></tr>

Blessed be he who paid such attention to you. And she told her mother- in-law whom she had worked with and said, The name of the man whom I worked with today is Boaz.</td></tr>
