<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>4:1</a></td><td class=td>这样，我们可说我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕照着肉体得了什么？<br>What then shall we say that Abraham our forefather according to the flesh has found? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>倘若亚伯拉罕是本于行为得称义，就有可夸的，只是在神面前并无可夸。<br>For if Abraham was justified out of works, he has something to boast in, but not before God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>原来经上说什么？说，“亚伯拉罕信神，这就算为他的义。”<br>For what does the Scripture say? "And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>作工的得工价，不是照着恩典，乃是照着所该得者算的。<br>Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>惟有不作工，只信靠那称不虔者为义之神的，他的信就算为他的义。<br>But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>4:6</a></td><td class=td>正如大卫也称那在行为以外，蒙神算为义的人为有福的：<br>Even as David also speaks blessing on the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works: </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>4:7</a></td><td class=td>“不法得赦免，罪得遮盖的人，是有福的。<br>"Blessed are they whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>4:8</a></td><td class=td>主绝不算为有罪的人，是有福的。”<br>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall by no means account sin.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>4:9</a></td><td class=td>如此，这称为有福的福是单加给受割礼的人，还是也加给未受割礼的人？因我们说，亚伯拉罕的信，就算为他的义，<br>Is this blessing then upon the circumcision only, or also upon the uncircumcision? For we say, Faith was accounted to Abraham as righteousness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>4:10</a></td><td class=td>是怎么算的？是在他受割礼的时候，还是在他未受割礼的时候？不是在受割礼的时候，乃是在未受割礼的时候。<br>How then was it accounted? While he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>4:11</a></td><td class=td>并且他受了割礼的记号，作他未受割礼时那信之义的印记，叫他作一切未受割礼而信之人的父，使他们也算为义；<br>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those in uncircumcision who believe, that righteousness might be accounted to them also, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>4:12</a></td><td class=td>又作受割礼之人的父，就是那些不但受割礼，并且照我们祖宗亚伯拉罕，未受割礼时之信的脚踪而行的人。<br>And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>4:13</a></td><td class=td>因为神应许亚伯拉罕，或他的后裔，必得承受世界，不是借着律法，乃是借着信的义。<br>For it was not through the law that the promise was made to Abraham or to his seed that he would be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>4:14</a></td><td class=td>若是本于律法的，才得为后嗣，信就成了虚空，应许也就失效了。<br>For if those of the law are heirs, faith has been made void and the promise has been annulled; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>4:15</a></td><td class=td>因为律法是惹动忿怒的；那里没有律法，那里就没有过犯。<br>For the law works out wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>4:16</a></td><td class=td>所以人得为后嗣是本于信，为要照着恩，使应许定然归给一切后裔，不但归给那本于律法的，也归给那本于亚伯拉罕之信的。<br>Therefore the inheritance is out of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise may be certain to all the seed, not to that which is of the law only, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>4:17</a></td><td class=td>亚伯拉罕在他所信那叫死人复活，又称无为有的神面前，是我们众人的父，如经上所记：“我已经立你作多国的父。”<br>(As it is written, "I have appointed you a father of many nations'') in the sight of God whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>4:18</a></td><td class=td>他在无可指望的时候，仍靠指望而信，就得以照先前所说，“你的后裔将要如此”的话，作多国的父。<br>He beyond hope believed in hope in order that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, "So shall your seed be.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>4:19</a></td><td class=td>他将近百岁的时候，虽然想到自己的身体如同已死，撒拉的生育也已断绝，他的信还是不软弱，<br>And not weakening in his faith, he considered his own body as already dead, being about a hundred years old, as well as the deadening of Sarah's womb; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>4:20</a></td><td class=td>总没有因不信而疑惑神的应许，反倒因信得着加力，将荣耀归与神，<br>But with regard to the promise of God, he did not doubt in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>4:21</a></td><td class=td>且满心确信，神所应许的，祂也必能作成；<br>And being fully persuaded that what He had promised He was able also to do. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>4:22</a></td><td class=td>所以这就算为他的义。<br>Therefore also it was accounted to him as righteousness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>4:23</a></td><td class=td>算为他的义这句话，不是单为他写的，<br>Now it was not written for his sake only that it was accounted to him, </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>4:25</a></td><td class=td>耶稣被交给人是为我们的过犯，复活是为我们的称义。<br>Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
