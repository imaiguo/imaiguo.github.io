<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>有的说，我们和儿女人口众多，要去得粮食吃饱活命；<br>For there were some who said, With our sons and our daughters we are many; therefore we must get grain that we may eat and live.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>有的说，我们典了田地、葡萄园、房屋，要在饥荒中得粮食；<br>And there were some who said, We have pledged our fields and our vineyards and our houses that we might get grain in this famine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>有的说，我们已经用田地、葡萄园作抵押，借了钱给王纳税。<br>And there were some who said, We have borrowed money against our fields and our vineyards for the king's tribute.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>其实我们的肉身与我们弟兄的肉身一样，我们的儿女与他们的儿女一般；看哪，我们将要使儿女作人的仆婢。我们的女儿已有为婢的；我们无力拯救，因为我们的田地、葡萄园，已经归了别人。<br>Yet now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children; and now we are bringing our sons and daughters into bondage as slaves. And some of our daughters have already been brought into bondage; and it is not in our power to deliver them, for our fields and vineyards belong to others.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>我听见他们的呼号和这些话，便甚发怒。<br>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>我心里筹画了，就斥责贵胄和官长，说，你们各人竟向自己的弟兄索取利息！于是我安排大会攻击他们。<br>And when I had considered this matter in my heart, I rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said to them, You men are charging interest, each man against his brother! And I set a great assembly against them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>5:8</a></td><td class=td>我对他们说，我们尽力赎回了我们的弟兄，就是卖与外邦的犹大人；你们还要卖弟兄，使我们赎回来么？他们静默不语，无话可答。<br>And I said to them, We have bought back our brothers the Jews who have been sold to the nations according to the best of our ability. So would you even sell your brothers that they would have to be sold back to us? And they held their peace and could find not a word to answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>我又说，你们所行的不善。为着避免我们仇敌外邦人的毁谤，你们行事不当敬畏我们的神么？<br>Then I said, The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>5:12</a></td><td class=td>众人说，我们必归还，不向他们索要，必照你所说的去行。我就召了祭司来，叫众人起誓，必照着所应许的去行。<br>And they said, We will restore it, and we will require nothing from them; so will we do, even as you say. Then I called for the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.</td></tr>

And all the assembly said, Amen; and they praised Jehovah. And the people acted according to this promise.</td></tr>

But I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>并且我坚定持续作城墙的工，并没有置买田地；我的仆人也都聚集在那里作工。<br>And I also applied myself to the work on this wall. And we did not acquire fields, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.</td></tr>

Yet for this I did not demand the food appointed for the governor, for the service was heavy upon this people.</td></tr>
