<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>14:2</a></td><td class=td>乃是照耶和华借摩西所吩咐的，把产业拈阄分给九个半支派。<br>By the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded through Moses for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>14:3</a></td><td class=td>原来摩西在约但河东，已经把产业给了那两个半支派；只是在他们中间，没有把产业给利未人。<br>For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe across the Jordan; but to the Levites he did not give an inheritance among them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>14:4</a></td><td class=td>因为约瑟的子孙是两个支派，就是玛拿西和以法莲，所以在那地没有把一分地业给利未人，但给他们城邑居住，并城邑的郊野，可以牧养他们的牲畜，安置他们的财物。<br>For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in with their pasture lands for their cattle and their substance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>14:5</a></td><td class=td>耶和华怎样吩咐摩西，以色列人就照样行，把地分了。<br>As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; thus they divided the land.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>14:7</a></td><td class=td>耶和华的仆人摩西从加低斯巴尼亚打发我窥探这地，那时我正四十岁；我按着心里的真诚向他回报。<br>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me out from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I returned such a word to him as was genuinely upon my heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>14:8</a></td><td class=td>然而，同我上去的众弟兄使百姓的心融化；但我专一跟从耶和华我的神。<br>However my brothers who went up with me made the people's heart melt, but I fully followed Jehovah my God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>14:9</a></td><td class=td>当日摩西起誓说，你脚所踏之地必定归你和你的子孙永远为业，因为你专一跟从耶和华我的神。<br>And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, for you have fully followed Jehovah my God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>14:10</a></td><td class=td>现在，看哪，自从耶和华对摩西说这话的时候，耶和华照祂所说的使我存活这四十五年；其间以色列人在旷野行走。看哪，现今我八十五岁了。<br>And now, look, Jehovah has kept me alive, as He said, for these forty-five years, since the time Jehovah spoke this word to Moses while Israel walked through the wilderness. And now, look, today I am eighty-five years old.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>14:11</a></td><td class=td>今天我还是强壮，像摩西打发我去的那天一样；无论是争战，是出入，我的力量那时如何，现在还是如何。<br>Today I am still as strong as I was on the day Moses sent me out; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for battle and for going out and coming in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>14:12</a></td><td class=td>现在求你将耶和华那日所说的这山地给我；因为那日你也曾听见那里有亚衲人，并宽大坚固的城邑。或者耶和华与我同在，我就把他们赶出去，正如耶和华所说的。<br>Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Jehovah spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that the Anakim were there with great fortified cities. It may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I will dispossess them, as Jehovah said.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>14:13</a></td><td class=td>于是约书亚为耶孚尼的儿子迦勒祝福，将希伯仑给他为业。<br>So Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.</td></tr>
