What is my iniquity, or what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>20:2</a></td><td class=td>约拿单对他说，断然不是！你绝不至于死。我父亲作事，无论大小，没有不叫我知道的。怎么独有这事隐瞒我呢？事情绝不会如此。<br>And he said to him, Far from it! You shall not die. My father does nothing great or small that he does not disclose to me. So why should my father hide this matter from me? Such would not happen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>20:3</a></td><td class=td>大卫又起誓说，你父亲准知我在你眼前蒙恩；所以他心里说，不如不叫约拿单知道这事，恐怕他愁烦。但我确实指着永活的耶和华起誓，又指着你的性命起誓，我离死不过一步。<br>Then David swore again and said, Your father fully knows that I have found favor in your sight; so he says, Do not let Jonathan know about this; otherwise, he will be grieved. But truly as Jehovah lives and as your soul lives, there is  but a step between me and death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>20:4</a></td><td class=td>约拿单对大卫说，凡你心里所求的，我必为你成就。<br>And Jonathan said to David, Whatever you say, I will do for you.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>20:6</a></td><td class=td>你父亲若察觉我不在，你就说，大卫切求我许他赶回自己的城伯利恒去，因为他全家在那里献年祭。<br>If your father misses me at all, you shall say, David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all his family.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>20:7</a></td><td class=td>你父亲若这样说，好；你仆人就平安了。他若大大发怒，你就知道他决意要害我。<br>If he says in this way, Fine;  then your servant will have peace. But if he becomes angry at all, know that evil has been determined by him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>20:8</a></td><td class=td>求你以恩慈待你仆人，因你已经带你仆人在耶和华面前与你结盟。我若有罪孽，不如你自己杀我，何必将我带到你父亲那里呢？<br>Deal kindly then with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Jehovah with you. But if there is any iniquity in me, you kill me. Why then should you bring me to your father?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>20:9</a></td><td class=td>约拿单说，这事绝不至临到你！我若知道我父亲决意害你，我岂不告诉你么？<br>And Jonathan said, Far be it from you! For if I knew at all that evil has been determined by my father to come upon you, would I not tell it to you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>20:10</a></td><td class=td>大卫对约拿单说，你父亲若用严厉的话回答你，谁来告诉我呢？<br>Then David said to Jonathan, Who will tell me whether or not your father has responded to you harshly?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>20:11</a></td><td class=td>约拿单对大卫说，来，我们往田野去罢。二人就往田野去了。<br>And Jonathan said to David, Come and let us go out into the field. And they both went out into the field.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>20:12</a></td><td class=td>约拿单对大卫说，愿耶和华以色列的神为证。明日约在这时候，或后天，我探我父亲的意思，若向你有好意，我就必打发人告诉你。<br>And Jonathan said to David, By Jehovah, the God of Israel: When I search out my father about this time tomorrow,  or on the following day, and if he is good toward David, I will surely send  word to you and disclose  it to you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>20:13</a></td><td class=td>我父亲若有意害你，我不告诉你使你平平安安的走，愿耶和华重重的降罚与我。愿耶和华与你同在，如同从前与我父亲同在一样。<br>May Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and even more, if it pleases my father to do you evil, and I do not disclose  it to you and send you away to go in peace.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>20:17</a></td><td class=td>约拿单因着对大卫的爱，就使大卫再起誓，因他爱大卫如同爱自己的性命。<br>And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</td></tr>

If I say to the boy, The arrows are there to this side of you; gather them; then come, for you have peace and there is no problem, as Jehovah lives.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>20:22</a></td><td class=td>我若这样对童子说，看哪，箭在你前头；你就要去，因为是耶和华打发你去的。<br>But if I speak in this way to the young man, The arrows are there beyond you; then go, for Jehovah has sent you away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>20:23</a></td><td class=td>至于你我今日所说的话，有耶和华在你我中间为证，直到永远。<br>And concerning this matter that I and you have spoken of, it is Jehovah who is between me and you forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>20:24</a></td><td class=td>大卫就去藏在田野。到了初一日，王坐席要吃饭。<br>So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat at the meal to eat.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>20:25</a></td><td class=td>王照常坐在他的座位，就是靠墙的座位上，约拿单起身而立，押尼珥坐在扫罗旁边，大卫的席位空着。<br>And the king sat on his seat as at other times, on his seat near the wall; and Jonathan rose up, and Abner sat down beside Saul, but David's place was empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>20:26</a></td><td class=td>然而那日扫罗没有说什么，他想大卫遇事以致不洁，他必定是不洁。<br>But Saul said nothing that day  about it, for he thought, Something has happened  to him; he is not clean; surely  he is not clean.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>20:27</a></td><td class=td>次日，就是初二日，大卫的席位还空着。扫罗对他儿子约拿单说，耶西的儿子为何昨日、今日都没有来吃饭？<br>And on the day after the new moon, the second day, David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has the son of Jesse come neither yesterday nor today to the meal?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>20:28</a></td><td class=td>约拿单回答扫罗说，大卫切求我许他往伯利恒去。<br>And Jonathan answered Saul, David asked leave of me earnestly  to go to Bethlehem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>20:29</a></td><td class=td>他说，求你让我去，因为我们家族在那城里有献祭的事；我兄长吩咐我去。如今我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你让我脱身去见我的弟兄；所以大卫没有赴王的席。<br>And he said, Let me go, I beg you; for our family has a sacrifice in that city, and my brother commanded me  to be there. So now if I have found favor in your sight, let me slip away to see my brothers. Therefore he has not come to the king's table.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>20:30</a></td><td class=td>扫罗向约拿单发怒，对他说，你这邪僻悖逆之妇人的儿子！我岂不知道你选择耶西的儿子，自取羞辱，并且使你母亲露体蒙羞么？<br>And Saul's anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>20:31</a></td><td class=td>耶西的儿子若在地上活着，你和你的国必站立不住。现在你要打发人去，将他捉拿交给我；他是该死的。<br>For as long as the son of Jesse is alive on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established. Now therefore send  someone and bring him to me, for he is as good as dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>20:32</a></td><td class=td>约拿单回答他父亲扫罗说，他为什么该被处死？他作了什么呢？<br>And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, Why must he be put to death? What has he done?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>20:33</a></td><td class=td>扫罗向约拿单抡枪要刺他，约拿单就知道他父亲决意要杀大卫。<br>But Saul threw his spear at him in order to strike him down. So Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to put David to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>20:34</a></td><td class=td>于是约拿单气忿忿的从席上起来，在这初二日没有吃饭；他因见父亲羞辱大卫，就为大卫愁烦。<br>And Jonathan rose up from the table in burning anger and did not eat any food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved about David because his father had shamed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>20:35</a></td><td class=td>到了次日早晨，约拿单按着与大卫约定的时候出到田野，有一个小僮仆跟着他。<br>Then in the morning Jonathan went forth to the field for the appointment with David, and a small boy was with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>20:36</a></td><td class=td>约拿单对僮仆说，你跑去，把我所射的箭找来。僮仆跑去，约拿单就把箭射在僮仆前头。<br>And he said to his boy, Run  and find the arrows that I am shooting. While the boy was running, he shot the arrow beyond him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>20:37</a></td><td class=td>僮仆到了约拿单落箭之地，约拿单在僮仆后面呼叫说，箭不是在你前头么？<br>And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called out after the boy and said, The arrow is there beyond you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>20:38</a></td><td class=td>约拿单又在僮仆后面呼叫说，速速的去，不要停留。约拿单的僮仆就把箭拾起，来到主人那里。<br>And Jonathan called out to the boy, Hurry up quickly; do not stay there. And Jonathan's boy gathered the arrows and came to his master.</td></tr>
