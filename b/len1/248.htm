<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>12:3</a></td><td class=td>我在这里，你们只管在耶和华面前，并在祂的受膏者面前，作见证指控我。我夺过谁的牛，抢过谁的驴，欺压过谁，虐待过谁，从谁手里受过贿赂因而眼瞎？若有，我必偿还。<br>Here I am; testify against me before Jehovah and before His anointed.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>12:19</a></td><td class=td>众民对撒母耳说，求你为仆人们祷告耶和华你的神，免得我们死亡，因为我们为自己求立王的事，是在我们一切的罪上又加了一件恶事。<br>Then all the people said to Samuel, Pray to Jehovah your God for your servants that we would not die, for we have added to all our sins the evil of asking for a king for ourselves.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>12:21</a></td><td class=td>不要偏离耶和华，因为你们若偏离祂，就会随从那无益且不能施拯救的虚空偶像，它们本是虚空的。<br>And do not turn away, for  your turning away would be after vain  idols, which cannot profit or deliver  you, for they are vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>12:22</a></td><td class=td>耶和华既喜悦把你们作成祂的子民，就必因祂的大名不撇弃祂的子民。<br>For because of His great name Jehovah will not forsake His people, for Jehovah has been pleased to make you a people for Himself.</td></tr>
