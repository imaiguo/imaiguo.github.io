<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>10:2</a></td><td class=td>他们要借此屈枉穷乏人的案情，夺去我民中困苦人的公理，好使寡妇成为他们的掳物，孤儿成为他们的掠物。<br>In order to turn the poor away from judgment, And to tear justice away from the afflicted among my people; That widows may be their spoil, And they may plunder orphans.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>10:3</a></td><td class=td>到降罚的日子，有灾祸从远方临到，那时你们怎样行呢？你们向谁逃奔求助呢？你们的荣耀撇在何处呢？<br>And what will you do for the day of visitation, And for the devastation that comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>10:4</a></td><td class=td>他们只得屈身在被掳的人以下，仆倒在被杀的人以下。虽然如此，耶和华的怒气还未转消，祂的手仍然伸出。<br>Unless one crouches behind prisoners, And they fall behind the slain? By all this His anger is not turned; His hand is still outstretched.</td></tr>

Or should the saw magnify itself above him who wields it? It would be like the rod wielding him who lifts it up, Like the staff lifting up him who is not wood.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>10:18</a></td><td class=td>又将他树林和肥田的荣耀，全然灭尽；他必像患病的人渐渐瘦弱一样。<br>The glory of his forest and of his garden land He will destroy, both soul and body; And he will be like a sick man wasting away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>10:19</a></td><td class=td>他林中剩下的树必稀少，就是孩子也能写其数。<br>And what is left of the trees of his forest will be so few in number That a young boy could record them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>10:23</a></td><td class=td>因为主万军之耶和华，正在全地之中成就所定灭绝的事。<br>For utter destruction and a strict decision is the Lord Jehovah of hosts performing in the midst of the whole land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>10:24</a></td><td class=td>所以主万军之耶和华如此说，住锡安我的百姓阿，亚述虽然用棍击打你，又照埃及所行的举杖攻击你，你却不要怕他。<br>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah of hosts, O my people dwelling in Zion, do not fear Assyria, who strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you the way Egypt did.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>10:26</a></td><td class=td>万军之耶和华要兴起鞭来攻击他们，好像在俄立磐石那里击杀米甸人一样；耶和华的杖要向海伸出，祂要照祂在埃及所行的，把杖举起。<br>And against them Jehovah of hosts will rouse up a whip like the stroke against Midian at the rock of Oreb; and His staff will be over the sea, and He will lift it up the way He did in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>10:27</a></td><td class=td>到那日，亚述的重担必离开你的肩头，他的轭必离开你的颈项；那轭也必因肥壮的缘故撑断。<br>And in that day their burden will be removed from your shoulders, and their yoke from off your neck; and the yoke will be broken due to the fatness.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>10:33</a></td><td class=td>看哪，主万军之耶和华以可怕的震撼削去树枝：长高的必被砍下，高大的必被伐低。<br>But now the Lord Jehovah of hosts Is lopping off the boughs with an awful crash: Those which are tall in height are hewn down, And those which are lofty are laid low.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>10:34</a></td><td class=td>祂要用铁器砍下丛林；利巴嫩必倒在威严者手下。<br>And He chops away the forest thickets with an iron ax; And Lebanon falls at the hands of a majestic One.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
