<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>15:2</a></td><td class=td>万军之耶和华如此说，以色列人从埃及上来的时候，在路上亚玛力人抵挡他们；为着亚玛力人向以色列人所作的，我要惩罚他们。<br>Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I will punish the Amalekites  for what they did to Israel when they set themselves against them in the way as they came up out of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>15:3</a></td><td class=td>现在你要去击打亚玛力人，灭绝他们所有的，不可怜惜他们，将男女、孩童、吃奶的，并牛、羊、骆驼和驴，尽都杀死。<br>Go now and strike the Amalekites; and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, oxen and sheep, camel and donkey.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>15:6</a></td><td class=td>扫罗对基尼人说，去罢，你们离开亚玛力人下去，恐怕我将你们和亚玛力人一同杀灭；因为以色列众人从埃及上来的时候，你们曾以恩慈待他们。于是基尼人离开亚玛力人去了。<br>And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites; otherwise, I will destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>15:12</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳清早起来，要在早晨迎接扫罗。有人告诉撒母耳说，扫罗去了迦密，在那里为自己立了记念碑，又回来，经过这里下到吉甲。<br>Then Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>15:15</a></td><td class=td>扫罗说，这些是从亚玛力人那里带来的；因为百姓爱惜上好的牛羊，要献与耶和华你的神；其余的，我们都灭绝了。<br>And Saul said, They have been brought from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to Jehovah your God, and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>15:16</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳对扫罗说，你住口罢，我要将耶和华昨夜向我所说的话告诉你。扫罗说，请讲。<br>Then Samuel said to Saul, Stop, and I will tell you what Jehovah spoke to me last night. And he said to him, Speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>15:17</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳说，你虽然以自己为小，岂不是以色列支派的元首么？耶和华膏了你作以色列的王。<br>And Samuel said, Though you are small in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah has anointed you king over Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>15:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和华差遣你行路，说，你去灭绝那些犯罪的亚玛力人，攻打他们，直到将他们灭尽。<br>And Jehovah sent you on a journey and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>15:19</a></td><td class=td>你为何没有听从耶和华的话，急忙掳掠财物，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事呢？<br>Why then did you not obey the voice of Jehovah, but flew upon the spoil and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>15:20</a></td><td class=td>扫罗对撒母耳说，我实在听从了耶和华的话，行了耶和华所差遣我行的路，擒了亚玛力王亚甲来，并灭绝了亚玛力人。<br>And Saul said to Samuel, I surely did obey the voice of Jehovah, and I went on the journey that Jehovah sent me on. And I have brought Agag the king of the Amalekites and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>15:21</a></td><td class=td>百姓却在所夺得的物中取了牛羊，就是当灭之物中最好的，要在吉甲献与耶和华你的神。<br>But of the spoil the people took sheep and oxen, the chief of those things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Jehovah your God in Gilgal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>15:22</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳说，耶和华喜悦燔祭和平安祭，岂如喜悦人听从祂的话呢？看哪，听从胜于献祭；听命胜于公羊的脂油。<br>And Samuel said, Does Jehovah delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices As much as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,  And to heed, than the fat of rams.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>15:23</a></td><td class=td>悖逆与行邪术的罪相等；顽梗与拜虚神和家神相同。你既厌弃耶和华的话，耶和华也厌弃你作王。<br>For rebellion is  like the sin of divination, And insubordination is  like  idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah, He has also rejected you from being king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>15:24</a></td><td class=td>扫罗对撒母耳说，我有罪了，我因惧怕百姓，听从他们的话，就违犯了耶和华的命令和你的言语。<br>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>15:25</a></td><td class=td>现在求你赦免我的罪，同我回去，我好敬拜耶和华。<br>Now therefore pardon my sin, I beg you, and return with me so that I may worship Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>15:26</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳对扫罗说，我不同你回去；因为你厌弃耶和华的话，耶和华也厌弃你作以色列的王。<br>But Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected you from being king over Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>15:27</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳转身要走，扫罗扯住他外袍的衣边，衣边就撕断了。<br>And when Samuel turned around to go, Saul seized the corner of his cloak, and it tore.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>15:28</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳对他说，今日耶和华已将以色列国从你身上撕断，将这国赐给与你亲近的人，他比你更好。<br>And Samuel said to him, Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today and has given it to an associate of yours, who is better than you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>15:29</a></td><td class=td>以色列的尊高者必不说谎，也不后悔；因为祂并非人，绝不后悔。<br>Moreover the Eminence of Israel does not lie nor repent, for He is not a man that He should repent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>15:30</a></td><td class=td>扫罗说，我有罪了，虽然如此，求你在我百姓的长老和以色列人面前尊重我，同我回去，我好敬拜耶和华你的神。<br>Then Saul said, I have sinned. Honor me now, I beg you, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me so that I may worship Jehovah your God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>15:31</a></td><td class=td>于是撒母耳跟随扫罗回去，扫罗就敬拜耶和华。<br>So Samuel returned after Saul, and Saul worshipped Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>15:32</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳说，把亚玛力王亚甲带到我这里来。亚甲就欢欢喜喜的来到他那里，因他心里说，死亡的苦楚必定转消了。<br>Then Samuel said, Bring Agag the king of the Amalekites near to me. And Agag came to him cheerfully, for Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death has turned.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>15:33</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳说，你怎样用刀使妇人丧子，你母亲在妇人中也必照样丧子。于是，撒母耳在吉甲耶和华面前，将亚甲砍成碎块。<br>And Samuel said, Just as your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>15:34</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳往拉玛去；扫罗也上他所住的基比亚，到自己的家去了。<br>And Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>15:35</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳直到死的日子，再没有去看扫罗；但撒母耳为扫罗悲伤。耶和华也后悔立扫罗为以色列的王。<br>And Samuel never again saw Saul unto the day of his death, though Samuel mourned for Saul.
