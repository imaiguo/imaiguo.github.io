<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>19:36</a></td><td class=td>这些事既是驳不倒的，你们就当安静，不可卤莽行事。<br>Since these things therefore cannot be disputed, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>19:37</a></td><td class=td>你们把这些人带来，他们并没有抢劫庙宇，也没有谤讟我们的女神。<br>For you have brought forth these men who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. </td></tr>
