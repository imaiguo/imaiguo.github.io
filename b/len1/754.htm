<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>9:1</a></td><td class=td>但愿我的头为众水，我的眼为泪的泉源，我好为我百姓中被杀的人，昼夜哭泣！<br>Oh, that my head were waters, And my eye a fountain of tears, That I might weep day and night For the slain of the daughter of my people!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>9:2</a></td><td class=td>惟愿我在旷野有行路人住宿之处，使我可以离开我的民出去，因他们都是行奸淫的，是行诡诈的会众。<br>Oh, that I had a traveler's lodging place in the wilderness That I might leave my people and go away from them, For all of them are adulterers and  an assembly of treacherous  men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>9:3</a></td><td class=td>他们弯起舌头像弓一样；在这地得势的，是谎言而非真理；他们乃是恶上加恶，并不认识我；这是耶和华说的。<br>They bend their tongue like their bow; Falsehood, and not truth, Prevails in the land; For they proceed from evil to evil, And they do not know Me, declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>9:4</a></td><td class=td>你们各人当谨防邻舍，不可信靠弟兄；因为弟兄尽行抓夺，邻舍都往来谗谤人。<br>Let each man be on guard against his neighbor And not confide in any brother; For every brother only supplants, And every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>9:5</a></td><td class=td>他们各人欺哄邻舍，不说真话；他们教导舌头说谎，劳劳碌碌的作孽。<br>And everyone deceives his neighbor And does not speak the truth; They teach their tongue to speak falsehood; They weary themselves committing iniquity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>9:6</a></td><td class=td>你的住处在诡诈之中；他们因行诡诈不肯认识我；这是耶和华说的。<br>Your dwelling is in the midst of  deceit; Through deceit they refuse to know Me, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>9:7</a></td><td class=td>所以万军之耶和华如此说，我要熬炼、试验他们；不然，我因我百姓的罪该怎样行呢？<br>Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, Indeed, I will refine them and test them; For what else can I do because of the daughter of My people?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>9:8</a></td><td class=td>他们的舌头是致命的箭，说话诡诈。人与邻舍口说和平话，心却谋害他。<br>Their tongue is a deadly arrow; It speaks deceit. Each speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, But in his heart he lays an ambush for him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>9:9</a></td><td class=td>耶和华说，我岂不因这些事讨他们的罪么？我魂岂不报复这样的国么？<br>Shall I not punish them for these things? Declares Jehovah; And on a nation such as this Shall My soul not avenge itself?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>9:10</a></td><td class=td>我要为山岭哭泣举哀，为旷野的草场扬声哀号，因为都已烧尽，甚至无人经过，人也听不见牲畜鸣叫；空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽，都已逃去。<br>For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing, And for the pastures of the wilderness, a lamentation; Because they have been burned up so that no one passes through, And the sound of cattle is not heard; Both the birds of the sky and the beasts Have fled and have gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>9:11</a></td><td class=td>我必使耶路撒冷变为乱堆，为野狗的住处；也必使犹大的城邑变为荒场，无人居住。<br>And I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, A habitation of jackals; And I will make the cities of Judah A desolation without inhabitant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>9:12</a></td><td class=td>谁是智慧人可以明白这事？耶和华的口向谁说过，使他可以述说？这地为何毁灭，烧尽如同旷野，甚至无人经过？<br>Who is the wise man who can understand this, and he to whom the mouth of Jehovah has spoken, that he might declare it? Why is the land destitute, burned like the wilderness, so that no one passes through?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>9:13</a></td><td class=td>耶和华说，因为这百姓离弃我在他们面前所设立的律法，没有听从我的话，也没有遵行我的律法；<br>And Jehovah said, Because they have forsaken My law, which I set before them, and have not listened to My voice or walked in My law,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>9:14</a></td><td class=td>只随从自己顽梗的心而行，照他们列祖所教训的，随从众巴力；<br>But have walked after the stubbornness of their heart and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them;</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>9:16</a></td><td class=td>我要把他们分散在列国中，就是他们和他们列祖素不认识的列国；我也要打发刀剑追杀他们，直到将他们灭尽。<br>And I will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers knew, and send the sword after them until I have consumed them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>9:17</a></td><td class=td>万军之耶和华如此说，你们应当思想，将唱哀歌的妇女召来，又打发人召灵巧的妇女来；<br>Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Consider, and call for the mourning women to come, And send for the skillful women to come;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>9:18</a></td><td class=td>叫她们速速为我们举哀，使我们眼泪汪汪，使我们的眼皮涌出水来。<br>Let them hasten and take up a wailing for us, That our eyes may shed tears And our eyelids may pour forth water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>9:19</a></td><td class=td>因为听见哀声出于锡安，说，我们是怎样的败落！我们大大的蒙羞！因为我们撇下了这地，因为人拆毁了我们的住处。<br>For a voice of wailing Was heard from Zion: How we are ruined! We are utterly put to shame! For we have forsaken the land Because they have cast down our dwellings.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>9:20</a></td><td class=td>妇女们哪，你们当听耶和华的话，你们的耳朵要领受祂口中的言语；又当教导你们的女儿哀哭，各人教导自己的邻舍唱哀歌。<br>Therefore listen, O women, to the word of Jehovah, And let your ear receive the word of His mouth; And teach your daughters wailing, And let each teach her neighbor a lamentation.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>9:21</a></td><td class=td>因为死亡已经上来，进了我们的窗户，入了我们的宫殿，要从街道上剪除孩童，从宽阔处剪除少年人。<br>For death has come up through our windows; It has entered our palaces To cut off the children from the streets, The young men from the open squares.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>9:22</a></td><td class=td>你当说，耶和华如此说，人的尸首必倒在田野像粪土，又像收割的人遗落的一把禾稼，无人收取。<br>Speak: Thus declares Jehovah, And the corpses of men will fall Like dung on the surface of the field And like a sheaf after the reaper, And there will be no one to gather them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>9:23</a></td><td class=td>耶和华如此说，智慧人不要因他的智慧夸口，勇士不要因他的勇力夸口，财主不要因他的财物夸口；<br>Thus says Jehovah, Let not the wise man glory in his  wisdom, And let not the mighty man glory  in his might; Let not the rich man glory in his  riches.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>9:24</a></td><td class=td>夸口的却因他有聪明，认识我是耶和华，又知道我喜悦在地上施行慈爱、公理和公义，以此夸口；这是耶和华说的。<br>But let him who glories glory in  this, That he has insight and knows Me, That I am Jehovah who exercises lovingkindness, Justice, and righteousness on earth; For in these things I delight,  declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>9:25</a></td><td class=td>耶和华说，日子将到，我要惩罚一切受过割礼，心却没有受割礼的；<br>Indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will punish all those who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>9:26</a></td><td class=td>我要惩罚埃及、犹大、以东、亚扪人、摩押、和一切住在旷野剃周围胡须的；因为列国人都没有受割礼，以色列全家心中也没有受割礼。<br>Egypt and Judah and Edom and the children of Ammon and Moab and all those who cut the corners of their beards, who inhabit the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
