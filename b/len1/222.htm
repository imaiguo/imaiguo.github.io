Why then do you come to me now that you are in distress?</td></tr>

But the king of Edom would not hear of it. And they also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he would not allow it. So Israel remained in Kadesh.</td></tr>

Thus they did not go through the territory of Moab, for the Arnon is the border of Moab.</td></tr>

And Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>11:22</a></td><td class=td>他们得了亚摩利人的四境，从亚嫩河到雅博河，从旷野直到约但河。<br>And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>11:23</a></td><td class=td>如今耶和华以色列的神，既为祂百姓以色列的缘故赶出亚摩利人，你竟要得他们的地么？<br>So now Jehovah the God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites for the sake of His people Israel. Should you then dispossess them?</td></tr>

Thus we will take possession of all that Jehovah our God dispossesses for our sake.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>11:25</a></td><td class=td>难道你比摩押王西拨的儿子巴勒还强么？他曾与以色列人争竞，或曾与他们争战么？<br>And now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab? Did he ever strive with Israel, or did he ever fight against them?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>11:26</a></td><td class=td>以色列人住希实本和属希实本的乡镇，亚罗珥和属亚罗珥的乡镇，并沿亚嫩河的一切城邑，已经有三百年了；在这三百年之内，你们为什么没有取回这些地方呢？<br>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>11:27</a></td><td class=td>原来我没有得罪你，你却攻打我，恶待我。愿审判人的耶和华今日在以色列人和亚扪人中间审断。<br>So I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong in fighting against me. Jehovah the Judge will judge today between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</td></tr>

And he passed through Gilead and through Manasseh; and he passed on to Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed on to the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>11:30</a></td><td class=td>耶弗他向耶和华许愿，说，你若真的将亚扪人交在我手中，<br>And Jephthah made a vow to Jehovah, and he said, If You will really deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>11:31</a></td><td class=td>我从亚扪人那里平平安安回来的时候，无论什么人，从我家门出来迎接我，就必归耶和华，我也必将他献上为燔祭。<br>Whoever comes out through the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon will be Jehovah's, and I will offer  him up as a burnt offering.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>11:32</a></td><td class=td>于是耶弗他往亚扪人那里去，攻打他们；耶和华将他们交在他手中，<br>And Jephthah passed on to the children of Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>11:33</a></td><td class=td>他就大大击杀他们，从亚罗珥到米匿，直到亚备勒基拉明，攻取了二十座城。这样亚扪人就在以色列人面前被制伏了。<br>And he struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, twenty cities, and to Abel-keramim, with a very great stroke.

You have brought me very low, and you are among those who trouble me. For I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I cannot retract it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>11:36</a></td><td class=td>他女儿回答说，我父阿，你既向耶和华开口，就当照你口中所出的向我行，因耶和华已经在你的仇敌亚扪人身上为你报仇；<br>And she said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Jehovah; do with me according to what has gone forth from your mouth, seeing that Jehovah has executed vengeance for you on your enemies, on the children of Ammon.</td></tr>
