<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>13:2</a></td><td class=td>因为他们没有拿食物和水来迎接以色列人，反而雇了巴兰咒诅他们，但我们的神使那咒诅变为祝福。<br>For they did not meet the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them; yet our God turned the curse into a blessing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>13:3</a></td><td class=td>众民听见这律法，就使一切闲杂人与以色列人分开。<br>And when they heard the law, they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>13:17</a></td><td class=td>我就斥责犹大的贵胄，对他们说，你们怎么行这恶事渎犯安息日呢？<br>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said to them, What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>13:18</a></td><td class=td>从前你们列祖岂不是这样行，以致我们的神使这一切灾祸临到我们和这城么？现在你们还渎犯安息日，使神的忿怒越发临到以色列。<br>Did not your fathers act this way, and did not our God bring all this trouble upon us and upon this city? But you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>13:19</a></td><td class=td>在安息日以前，耶路撒冷城门日落有黑影的时候，我就吩咐人将门关锁，并且吩咐人不准开放，直到安息日过了；我又派我几个仆人在城门站岗，免得有人在安息日担什么担子进来。<br>And when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and commanded that they not be opened until after the Sabbath; and I set some of my servants at the gates so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>13:20</a></td><td class=td>于是商人和贩卖各样货物的，有一两次在耶路撒冷城外过夜。<br>Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>13:21</a></td><td class=td>我就警戒他们，说，你们为何在城墙前面过夜？若再这样，我必下手拿办你们。从此以后，他们在安息日就不来了。<br>But I testified against them and said to them, Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>13:22</a></td><td class=td>我吩咐利未人当洁净自己，并来守城门，使安息日分别为圣。我的神阿，求你也因这事记念我，照你的大慈爱怜惜我。<br>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and that they should come and keep the gates, in order to sanctify the Sabbath day. For this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>13:23</a></td><td class=td>那些日子，我也见犹大人娶了亚实突、亚扪、摩押的女子为妻。<br>In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab;</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>13:25</a></td><td class=td>我就斥责他们，咒诅他们，打了他们几个人，拔下他们的头发，叫他们指着神起誓，我说，你们不可将自己的女儿嫁给他们的儿子，也不可为自己的儿子和自己娶他们的女儿。<br>And I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair; and I made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>13:26</a></td><td class=td>我又说，以色列王所罗门不是在这些事上犯罪么？在多国中并没有一王像他，且蒙他神所爱，神使他作全以色列的王；然而连他也被外邦女子引诱犯罪。<br>Did not Solomon the king of Israel sin in these matters? And among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; yet the foreign wives caused even him to sin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>13:27</a></td><td class=td>难道我们要听从你们，行这一切大恶，娶外邦女子为妻，行事不忠信得罪我们的神么？<br>Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God in marrying foreign women?</td></tr>
