<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>23:15</a></td><td class=td>大卫知道扫罗出来寻索他的命。那时，他在西弗旷野的何列斯；<br>And David saw that Saul went forth to seek his life, and David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>23:16</a></td><td class=td>扫罗的儿子约拿单起身，往何列斯去见大卫，使他倚靠神刚强行事；<br>Then Jonathan the son of Saul rose up and went to David at Horesh, and he strengthened his hand in God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>23:17</a></td><td class=td>对他说，不要惧怕。我父亲扫罗的手必构不到你；你必作以色列的王，我必在你以下位居第二。这事连我父亲扫罗也知道了。<br>And he said to him, Do not be afraid, for the hand of Saul my father will not find you; and you will become king over Israel, and I will be second to you; and even Saul my father knows that.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>23:26</a></td><td class=td>扫罗在山这边走，大卫和跟随他的人在山那边走。大卫急忙躲避扫罗；因为扫罗和跟随他的人，四面围住大卫和跟随他的人，要拿获他们。<br>And Saul went on one side of the mountain, while David and his men  went on the other side of the mountain.
