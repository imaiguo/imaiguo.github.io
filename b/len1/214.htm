<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>3:22</a></td><td class=td>连剑柄也随着剑身刺进去了；肥肉把剑身夹住，他没有把剑从王的肚腹拔出来。他就出到庭院。<br>And the hilt also went in, after the blade; and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the dagger from his belly. And he went out into the courtyard.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>3:23</a></td><td class=td>以笏出到游廊，将楼门关锁，把王关在里面。<br>Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and he closed the doors of the upper room on  Eglon and locked them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>3:25</a></td><td class=td>他们等烦了，见王仍不开楼门，就拿钥匙开了；不料，他们的主人已倒在地上死了。<br>And they waited until they were ashamed, but still he was not opening the doors of the upper room. Then they took the key and opened them. And there was their lord, fallen to the ground dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>3:26</a></td><td class=td>他们耽延的时候，以笏逃跑了，经过雕像那里，逃到西伊拉。<br>And Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed by the sculptured idols and escaped to Seirah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>3:27</a></td><td class=td>到了，就在以法莲山地吹角；以色列人随着他下了山地，他在他们前头领路，<br>And when he arrived, he blew the horn in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came down with him from the hill country, and he was before them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>3:28</a></td><td class=td>对他们说，你们紧紧跟着我，因为耶和华已经把你们的仇敌摩押人交在你们手中。于是他们跟着他下去，把守约但河的渡口，拦截摩押人，不容一人过去。<br>And he said to them, Follow closely after me, for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites; and they let no man cross over.</td></tr>
