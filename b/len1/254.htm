<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>18:5</a></td><td class=td>扫罗无论差遣大卫往何处，他都前去，并且作事精明。扫罗就立他作战士长，众百姓和扫罗的臣仆都看为美。<br>And David went forth; on every  mission that Saul sent him he acted prudently. Therefore Saul set him over the men of battle, and it was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.</td></tr>

Therefore Saul said to David, For the second time, you may be my son-in-law today.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>18:22</a></td><td class=td>扫罗吩咐臣仆说，你们暗中对大卫说，看哪，王喜悦你，王的臣仆也都喜爱你，所以你当作王的女婿。<br>Then Saul commanded his servants, Speak to David privately, saying, See, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you. So now become the king's son-in-law.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>18:23</a></td><td class=td>扫罗的臣仆就把这些话说给大卫听。大卫说，你们以为作王的女婿是轻微的事么？我是贫穷卑微的人。<br>And Saul's servants spoke these words in David's ears.

For Saul planned to have David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>18:26</a></td><td class=td>扫罗的臣仆将这些话告诉大卫，大卫就欢喜作王的女婿。日期还没有满，<br>So when his servants told David these things, David was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. And when the time had not  yet expired,</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>18:30</a></td><td class=td>非利士人的军长出来打仗；每逢他们出来时，大卫总比扫罗的众臣仆作事更精明，因此他的名极受尊重。<br>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth; and as often as they went forth, David succeeded more than all the servants of Saul. So his name was very highly esteemed.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
