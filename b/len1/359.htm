<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>21:3</a></td><td class=td>约押说，愿耶和华使祂的百姓比现在加增百倍。我主我王阿，他们不都是我主的仆人么？我主为何要求作这事？为何使以色列人陷在罪里呢？<br>And Joab said, May Jehovah add to His people a hundred times as many as they are. But, O my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? Why does my lord request this? Why should he become a cause of guilt to Israel?</td></tr>

And now see what word I should return to Him who sent me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>21:13</a></td><td class=td>大卫对迦得说，我甚为难；我愿落在耶和华的手里，因为祂有丰盛的怜悯；我不愿落在人的手里。<br>And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait; let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for His compassions are very great; and do not let me fall into the hand of man.</td></tr>

And He said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now hold back your hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</td></tr>

And it is I who have sinned and acted very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O Jehovah my God, let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against the house of my father, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>21:22</a></td><td class=td>大卫对阿珥楠说，请你按足价将这禾场的地卖给我，我好在其上为耶和华筑一座坛，使百姓受的灾疫止住。<br>And David said to Ornan, Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to Jehovah. For the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>21:23</a></td><td class=td>阿珥楠对大卫说，你只管拿去；我主我王看怎样好，就怎样行罢。看哪，我也将牛给你作燔祭，打粮的器具给你当柴烧，麦子给你作素祭。这些我都送给你。<br>And Ornan said to David, Take it; and may my lord the king do whatever seems good in his sight. Look, I have given the oxen for the burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for the wood and the wheat for the meal offering-all this I give.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>21:24</a></td><td class=td>大卫王对阿珥楠说，不然；我必用足价向你买。我不愿拿你的物给耶和华，也不愿用白得之物献为燔祭。<br>But King David said to Ornan, No; but I will surely buy it for the full price, for I will not take what is yours for Jehovah and offer up burnt offerings that cost me nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>21:25</a></td><td class=td>于是大卫为那块地给了阿珥楠六百舍客勒重的金子。<br>So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>21:26</a></td><td class=td>大卫在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，献燔祭和平安祭。他呼求耶和华，耶和华就应允他，使火从天降在燔祭坛上。<br>And there David built an altar to Jehovah, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
