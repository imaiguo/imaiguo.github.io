<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>19:3</a></td><td class=td>有法利赛人到耶稣跟前来，试诱祂，说，人因任何缘故，都可以休妻么？<br>And some Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>19:4</a></td><td class=td>祂就回答说，难道你们没有念过，那起初造人的，是造男造女，<br>And He answered and said, Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>19:5</a></td><td class=td>并且说，“为这缘故，人要离开父母，与妻子联合，二人成为一体”么？<br>And said, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh''? </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>19:9</a></td><td class=td>我告诉你们，凡休妻另娶的，若不是因淫乱的缘故，就是犯奸淫；有人娶那被休的妇人，也是犯奸淫。<br>But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her who has been divorced commits adultery. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>19:10</a></td><td class=td>门徒对祂说，人和妻子的事既是这样，倒不如不结婚。<br>His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry. </td></tr>

He who can accept it, let him accept it. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>19:13</a></td><td class=td>那时，有人带着小孩子到耶稣那里，要祂为他们按手祷告，门徒就责备那些人。<br>Then little children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>19:21</a></td><td class=td>耶稣对他说，你若想要完全，就要去变卖你的家业，分给穷人，就必有财宝在诸天之上，你还要来跟从我。<br>Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>19:22</a></td><td class=td>那青年人听见这话，就忧忧郁郁的走了，因为他有很多产业。<br>But the young man, hearing this word, went away sorrowing, for he had many possessions. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>19:23</a></td><td class=td>于是耶稣对门徒说，我实在告诉你们，财主进诸天的国是难的。<br>And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, Only with difficulty will a rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>19:25</a></td><td class=td>门徒听见了，就极其惊讶，说，这样谁能得救？<br>And when the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, Who then can be saved? </td></tr>
