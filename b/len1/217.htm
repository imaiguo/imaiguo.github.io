<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>6:24</a></td><td class=td>于是基甸在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，起名叫耶和华沙龙。这坛到如今还在亚比以谢族的俄弗拉。<br>Then Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah, and he called it Jehovah-shalom. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>6:25</a></td><td class=td>当那夜，耶和华对基甸说，你取你父亲的牛来，就是那七岁的第二只牛，并且拆毁你父亲为巴力所筑的坛，砍下坛旁的木像，<br>And that night Jehovah said to him, Take your father's bull, that is, the second bull, seven years old; and tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>6:26</a></td><td class=td>在这保障顶上整整齐齐的为耶和华你的神筑一座坛，将第二只牛献为燔祭，用你所砍下的木像作柴。<br>And build an altar to Jehovah your God upon the top of this stronghold in the ordered manner.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>6:27</a></td><td class=td>基甸就从他仆人中挑了十个人，照着耶和华告诉他的行了。他因怕父家和本城的人，不敢在白昼行事，就在夜间行了。<br>So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as Jehovah had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father's house and the men of the city to do it by day, he did it at night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>6:28</a></td><td class=td>城里的人清早起来，见巴力的坛拆毁，坛旁的木像砍下，第二只牛献在新筑的坛上，<br>And when the men of the city rose up early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, broken down; and the Asherah beside it was cut down.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>6:29</a></td><td class=td>就彼此说，这事是谁作的？他们查究寻访之后，就说，这是约阿施的儿子基甸作的。<br>And they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And after they inquired and sought about, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>6:30</a></td><td class=td>城里的人对约阿施说，将你儿子交出来，好治死他；因为他拆毁了巴力的坛，砍下坛旁的木像。<br>Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>6:31</a></td><td class=td>约阿施对站着攻击他的众人说，你们是为巴力争辩么？你们要救他么？谁为他争辩，就要趁着早晨将谁处死。巴力若是神，有人拆毁他的坛，让他为自己争辩罢。<br>And Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him will be put to death while it is still morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself; for his altar has been broken down.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>6:32</a></td><td class=td>所以当日人称基甸为耶路巴力，意思说，他拆毁巴力的坛，让巴力与他争辩。<br>Therefore on that day he named  Gideon Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, for he has broken down his altar.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>6:33</a></td><td class=td>那时，所有的米甸人、亚玛力人、和东方人都聚集过河，在耶斯列谷安营。<br>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east gathered together, and they crossed over and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>6:34</a></td><td class=td>耶和华的灵披戴在基甸身上，他就吹角；亚比以谢族都应召跟随他。<br>And the Spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon; and he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called up behind him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>6:35</a></td><td class=td>他打发使者到全玛拿西，玛拿西人也应召跟随他。他又打发使者到亚设、西布伦、拿弗他利，那些地方的人也都上来与他们会合。<br>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they were also called up behind him. And he sent messengers throughout Asher and Zebulun and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>6:36</a></td><td class=td>基甸对神说，你若照着你所说的，要借我的手拯救以色列，<br>And Gideon said to God, If indeed You will save Israel through my hand, as You have said,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>6:37</a></td><td class=td>我就把一团羊毛放在禾场上：若单是羊毛上有露水，而地上都是干的，我就知道你要照着你所说的，借我的手拯救以色列。<br>I am laying here a fleece of wool on the threshing floor: If there is dew on the fleece alone and it is dry on all the ground, I will know that You will save Israel through my hand, as You have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>6:38</a></td><td class=td>次日基甸清早起来，见果然是这样；他将羊毛挤一挤，从羊毛中拧出满盆的露水来。<br>And so it happened. When he rose up early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung dew from the fleece, a bowlful of water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>6:39</a></td><td class=td>基甸又对神说，求你不要向我发怒，我再说这一次：让我将羊毛再试一次。但愿只有羊毛是干的，而地上都有露水。<br>Then Gideon said to God, May Your anger not burn against me, but allow me to speak only this one time. Allow me to make this test with the fleece only this one time. Let it be dry on the fleece only, and let there be dew on all the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=40>6:40</a></td><td class=td>这夜神也如此行，只有羊毛是干的，而地上都有露水。<br>And God did so that night, so that it was dry on the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
