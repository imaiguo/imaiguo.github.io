<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>30:36</a></td><td class=td>又使自己和雅各相离三天的路程；雅各就牧养拉班其余的羊。<br>And he set a distance of a three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>30:38</a></td><td class=td>他将剥了皮的枝子，对着羊群，插在羊群喝水的水槽里；羊来喝水的时候，公母交配。<br>And he set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, in the watering places where the flocks came to drink; and they bred when they came to drink.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>30:39</a></td><td class=td>羊对着枝子交配，就生下有纹的、有点的、有斑的来。<br>And the flocks bred before the rods; and the flocks brought forth young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=40>30:40</a></td><td class=td>雅各把羊羔分出来，使拉班的羊与这有纹和黑色的羊相对，把自己的羊另放一处，不叫他的羊和拉班的羊混杂。<br>And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flock toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban, and he put his own herds apart and did not put them with Laban's flock.</td></tr>
