<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>19:3</a></td><td class=td>那日百姓偷偷的进城，就如败阵逃跑、惭愧的民偷偷逃走一般。<br>And the people stole into the city that day as shamed people steal away when they flee in battle.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>19:4</a></td><td class=td>王蒙着脸，大声哀号说，我儿押沙龙阿！押沙龙，我儿，我儿阿！<br>And the king covered his face and cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>19:5</a></td><td class=td>约押进屋子去见王，说，你今日使你一切仆人脸面惭愧了；他们今日救了你的性命，和你儿女妻妾的性命，<br>Then Joab came to the king at his house and said, Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants, who saved your life today and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>19:6</a></td><td class=td>你却爱那些恨你的人，恨那些爱你的人；你今日表明了，将帅和仆人对你不算什么。我今日才晓得，若押沙龙活着，我们都死亡，你就喜悦了。<br>In that you love those who hate you and hate those who love you; for you have made it clear today that princes and servants are nothing to you. But I realize today that if Absalom had lived and we all had died today, then it would have been fine in your sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>19:7</a></td><td class=td>现在你当起来，出去安慰你仆人的心。我指着耶和华起誓，你若不出去，今夜必无一人与你同在一处；这祸患就比你从幼年到如今所遭的更甚。<br>Now therefore rise up; go forth and comfort the hearts of your servants. For I swear by Jehovah that if you do not go forth, not a man will remain with you tonight; and that will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>19:8</a></td><td class=td>于是王起来，坐在城门口。有人告诉众民说，看哪，王坐在城门口；众民就都到王面前。以色列人已经逃跑，各人回自己的帐棚去了。<br>So the king rose up and sat in the gate.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>19:10</a></td><td class=td>我们所膏为王，治理我们的押沙龙，已经阵亡。现在为什么不出一言请王回来呢？<br>But Absalom, whom we anointed  as king over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>19:11</a></td><td class=td>大卫王差人去见祭司撒督和亚比亚他，说，你们当向犹大长老说，全以色列的人已经传话到王那里，你们在这事上为什么落后呢？<br>And King David sent  word to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, seeing that the word of all Israel has come to the king at his house?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>19:15</a></td><td class=td>王就回来，到了约但河；犹大人来到吉甲，要去迎接王，请王过约但河。<br>So the king returned and came to the Jordan, and Judah came to Gilgal to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>19:18</a></td><td class=td>有渡船过去，渡王的家眷，照王所看为好的而行。王要过约但河的时候，基拉的儿子示每俯伏在王面前，<br>And the crossing was being made in order to bring the king's household over and to do whatever was good in his sight. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>19:19</a></td><td class=td>对王说，求我主不要算我为有罪；我主我王出耶路撒冷的那日，你仆人所行悖逆的事，求我主不要记念，也不要放在心上。<br>And he said to the king, Let not my lord consider me guilty; and do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king went forth from Jerusalem, that the king should take it to heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>19:20</a></td><td class=td>你仆人明知自己有罪，所以我今日来了；在约瑟全家之中，我是首先下来迎接我主我王的。<br>For your servant knows that I have sinned; and now I have come today, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down, to meet my lord the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>19:21</a></td><td class=td>洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛回应说，示每既咒骂耶和华的受膏者，不应当为此处死他么？<br>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, for he has cursed Jehovah's anointed?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>19:22</a></td><td class=td>大卫说，洗鲁雅的儿子，我与你们何干，使你们今日作我的对头呢？今日在以色列中岂可处死人呢？我岂不知今日我作以色列的王么？<br>And David said, What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah, that you should be an adversary to me today? Should any man in Israel be put to death today? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>19:23</a></td><td class=td>于是王对示每说，你必不死。王又向他起誓。<br>And the king said to Shimei, You will not die. And the king swore  so to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>19:24</a></td><td class=td>扫罗的孙子米非波设也下去迎接王。他自从王离去的那天，直到王平平安安回来的日子，没有修脚，没有剃胡须，也没有洗衣服。<br>Then Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. Now he had neither taken care of his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came back in peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>19:25</a></td><td class=td>他从耶路撒冷来迎接王的时候，王问他说，米非波设，你为什么没有与我同去呢？<br>And when he came  from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>19:26</a></td><td class=td>他说，我主我王阿，仆人是瘸腿的。那日我心里说，我要给自己备驴骑上，与王同去，无奈我的仆人欺哄了我，<br>And he said, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said, I will saddle myself a donkey that I may ride on it and go with the king. For your servant is lame.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>19:27</a></td><td class=td>又在我主我王面前谗毁我。然而我主我王如同神的使者一般；你看怎样好，就怎样行罢。<br>And Ziba slandered your servant before my lord the king. But my lord the king is like an angel of God; therefore do what is good in your sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>19:28</a></td><td class=td>因为我祖全家的人，对于我主我王，不过是该死的人，你却将仆人列于在王席上吃饭的人中，我现在还有什么道理再向王哀求呢？<br>For all my father's house were but men worthy of death before my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right then do I have to cry out more to the king?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>19:29</a></td><td class=td>王对他说，你何必再题你的事呢？我说，你要与洗巴均分地土。<br>And the king said to him, Why speak any more of your affairs? I say that you and Ziba shall divide the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>19:30</a></td><td class=td>米非波设对王说，我主我王既平平安安的回宫，就任凭洗巴都取了也可以。<br>And Mephibosheth said to the king, Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has arrived at his house in peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>19:31</a></td><td class=td>基列人巴西莱从罗基琳下来，要送王过约但河，就与王一同过了约但河。<br>Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and he crossed over the Jordan with the king, to escort him through the Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>19:32</a></td><td class=td>巴西莱非常老迈，已经八十岁了。王住在玛哈念的时候，他曾供养王；他原是大富户。<br>And Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age; and he had provided the king with food while he remained in Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>19:33</a></td><td class=td>王对巴西莱说，你与我一同过去，我要在耶路撒冷供养你，使你在我身边。<br>And the king said to Barzillai, Cross over with me, and I will provide you with food in Jerusalem at my side.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>19:34</a></td><td class=td>巴西莱对王说，我在世的年日还能有多少，使我与王同上耶路撒冷呢？<br>But Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>19:35</a></td><td class=td>我现在八十岁了，还能尝出饮食的滋味、辨别美恶么？还能听男女歌唱的声音么？仆人何必还累赘我主我王呢？<br>I am eighty years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat and what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be a further burden to my lord the king?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>19:36</a></td><td class=td>仆人只不过略走一点路，陪王过约但河，王何必赐我这样的赏报呢？<br>Your servant would just cross a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why then should the king reward me with such a reward?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>19:37</a></td><td class=td>求你准仆人回去，好死在我本城，葬在我父母的墓旁。这里有你的仆人金罕，让他同我主我王过去；你看怎样好，就怎样待他。<br>Let your servant return that I may die in my city near the grave of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham, let him cross over with my lord the king; and do with him what is good in your sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>19:38</a></td><td class=td>王说，金罕可以与我一同过去；你看怎样好，我就怎样待他；凡你要我作的，我都必为你成就。<br>And the king said, Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do with him what is good in your sight; and whatever you wish for me to do, I will do for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>19:39</a></td><td class=td>于是众民过约但河，王也过去。王与巴西莱亲嘴，为他祝福，巴西莱就回本地去了。<br>And all the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king crossed over. And the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=40>19:40</a></td><td class=td>王过去，到了吉甲，金罕也跟他过去。犹大众民和以色列民的一半也都送王过去。<br>So the king crossed over to Gilgal, and Chimham crossed over with him. And all the people of Judah, and half the people of Israel as well, brought the king over.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=41>19:41</a></td><td class=td>以色列众人来见王，对王说，我们弟兄犹大人为什么偷偷的送王和王的家眷，以及所有属大卫的人过约但河？<br>Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan along with the men of David with him?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=42>19:42</a></td><td class=td>犹大众人回答以色列人说，因为王与我们是亲属，你们为何因这事发怒？我们吃了王的什么呢？王赐了我们什么礼物呢？<br>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's expense? Or has he given us any gift?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=43>19:43</a></td><td class=td>以色列人回答犹大人说，按支派，我们在王身上有十分；在大卫身上，我们也比你们更有分。你们为何藐视我们？请王回来不是我们先说的么？但犹大人的话比以色列人的话更硬。<br>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, We have ten parts in the king, and in David too we have more than you. Why then have you despised us? And were we not the first to speak of bringing our king back? But the speaking of the men of Judah was more prevailing than the speaking of the men of Israel.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
