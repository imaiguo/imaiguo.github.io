<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>5:1</a></td><td class=td>亚兰王的元帅乃缦，在他主人面前为大，极受尊宠，因耶和华曾借他使亚兰人得胜；他又是大能的勇士，只是患了痲疯。<br>Now Naaman, the captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man in the sight of his master and highly respected, because by him Jehovah had given deliverance to Syria. But the man, though a mighty man of valor, was a leper.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>先前亚兰人结队出去，从以色列地掳了一个小女子，她就在乃缦的妻子面前伺候她。<br>And the Syrians had gone out in bands and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel, and she waited on Naaman's wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>她对主母说，巴不得我主人在撒玛利亚的申言者面前，那么，他必能治好主人的痲疯。<br>And she said to her mistress, If only my master were  with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>乃缦进去，告诉他主人说，从以色列地来的女子如此如此说。<br>And Naaman went in and told his master, saying, Thus and thus did the girl who is from the land of Israel say.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>亚兰王说，你可以去，我也会送信给以色列王。于是乃缦手中带着银子十他连得，金子六千舍客勒，衣裳十套，就去了；<br>Then the king of Syria said, Go then, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went and took  with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold and ten changes of clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>且带信给以色列王，信上说，现在这信到了你那里，你就知道我打发臣仆乃缦去见你，是要你治好他的痲疯。<br>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read: And now, when this letter comes to you, I am sending Naaman my servant to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>以色列王读了信就撕裂衣服，说，我岂是神，能使人死、使人活呢？这人竟打发人来，叫我治好一个人的痲疯。你们留意，看看这人是怎样寻隙攻击我。<br>And when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, Am I God to put to death and to give life, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Therefore consider now and see how he seeks an occasion against me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>5:8</a></td><td class=td>神人以利沙听见以色列王撕裂衣服，就打发人去见王，说，你为什么撕了衣服呢？可以使那人到我这里来，他就知道以色列中有申言者了。<br>And when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent word to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>于是，乃缦带着车马来了，站在以利沙的家门口。<br>And Naaman came with his horses and his chariot and stood at the entrance of the house of Elisha.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>以利沙打发一个使者，对乃缦说，你去在约但河中沐浴七次，你的肉必复原，你就必得洁净。<br>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be  restored; and you shall be clean.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>5:11</a></td><td class=td>乃缦却发怒走了，说，我想他必定出来见我，站着呼求耶和华他神的名，在患处以上摇手，治好这痲疯。<br>But Naaman became furious and went away and said, I thought, He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>5:12</a></td><td class=td>大马色的河亚罢拿和法珥法，岂不比以色列的一切水更好么？我不能在那里沐浴，得洁净么？于是气忿忿的转身去了。<br>Are not the  Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>5:13</a></td><td class=td>他的仆人进前来，对他说，我父阿，申言者若叫你作一件大事，你岂不作么？何况说你去沐浴而得洁净呢？<br>And his servants came near and spoke to him and said, My father, had the prophet told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, Wash and be clean?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>5:14</a></td><td class=td>于是乃缦下去，照着神人的话，在约但河里浸了七次。他的肉复原，好像小孩子的肉，他就洁净了。<br>So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times according to the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored to be like the flesh of a little boy, and he was clean.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>5:15</a></td><td class=td>乃缦带着一切跟随他的人，回到神人那里；他进去，站在他面前，说，如今我知道，除了在以色列之外，全地并没有神。现在求你收下仆人的礼物。<br>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him and said, Now I know that there is no God in all the earth except with Israel. And now, please accept a present from your servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>以利沙说，我指着永活的耶和华，就是我侍立在祂面前的那位起誓，我必不接受。<br>But he said, As Jehovah lives, before whom I stand, I will receive nothing. And Naaman urged him to take it, but he refused.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>5:17</a></td><td class=td>乃缦再三的求他，他却不接受。乃缦说，你若不肯接受，请将两骡子驮的土赐给你仆人，因你仆人必不再将燔祭或平安祭献与别神，只献给耶和华。<br>And Naaman said, Then if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth, for your servant will no more offer burnt offerings and sacrifices to other gods, but to Jehovah only.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>5:18</a></td><td class=td>惟有这件事，愿耶和华饶恕你仆人：我主人进临门庙叩拜的时候，我用手搀他，我在临门庙也就叩拜。我在临门庙叩拜的这事，愿耶和华饶恕仆人。<br>In this matter may Jehovah pardon your servant: When my master goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there and leans on my arm, and I bow down in the house of Rimmon, when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may Jehovah pardon your servant in this matter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>5:19</a></td><td class=td>以利沙对他说，你平平安安的去罢。乃缦离开他走了不远，<br>And he said to him, Go in peace. And when he had gone from him a little way,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>5:20</a></td><td class=td>神人以利沙的仆人基哈西心里说，我主人白白放过这亚兰人乃缦，不从他手里受他带来的礼物，我指着永活的耶和华起誓，我必跑去追上他，向他要些东西。<br>Gehazi, the attendant of Elisha the man of God said, Now my master has spared Naaman this Syrian by not receiving from his hand that which he brought. As Jehovah lives, I will run after him and take something from him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>5:21</a></td><td class=td>于是基哈西追赶乃缦。乃缦看见有人追赶，就急忙下车迎着他，说，都平安么？<br>So Gehazi pursued Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him and said, Is all well?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>5:22</a></td><td class=td>他说，都平安。我主人打发我来说，刚才有两个少年人，是申言者的门徒，从以法莲山地来见我；请你赐他们一他连得银子，两套衣裳。<br>And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Now at this moment two young men from among the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim; please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>5:23</a></td><td class=td>乃缦说，请接受二他连得。他再三的促请基哈西，并将二他连得银子包在两个口袋里，连同两套衣裳，交给两个仆人；他们就在基哈西前头抬着走。<br>And Naaman said, Please take two talents. And he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothes, and gave them to two of his attendants; and they carried them before him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>5:24</a></td><td class=td>到了山冈，基哈西从他们手中接过来，存放在屋里；然后打发他们离去，他们就走了。<br>And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house. And he sent the men away, and they departed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>5:25</a></td><td class=td>基哈西进去，站在他主人面前。以利沙问他说，基哈西，你从那里来？他说，仆人没有往那里去。<br>And he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, Where have you come from, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant has not gone anywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>5:26</a></td><td class=td>以利沙对他说，那人下车转回迎你的时候，我的心岂没有去呢？这岂是接受银子和衣裳，买橄榄园、葡萄园、牛羊、仆婢的时候呢？<br>And he said to him, Did not my heart go with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive silver and to receive clothing and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and male servants and female servants?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>5:27</a></td><td class=td>因此，乃缦的痲疯必沾附于你和你的后裔，直到永远。基哈西从以利沙面前出去，就患了痲疯，像雪那样白。<br>Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cleave to you and to your seed forever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
