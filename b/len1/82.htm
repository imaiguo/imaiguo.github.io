<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>32:2</a></td><td class=td>亚伦对他们说，把你们妻子、儿子、女儿耳上的金环摘下，拿来给我。<br>And Aaron said to them, Tear off the gold rings, which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>32:4</a></td><td class=td>亚伦从他们手里接过来，铸了一只牛犊，是用雕刻的工具作成的。他们就说，以色列阿，这是领你从埃及地上来的神。<br>And he took the gold from their hand and fashioned it with an engraving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>32:5</a></td><td class=td>亚伦看见，就在牛犊面前筑坛，并且宣告说，明日要向耶和华守节。<br>And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; then Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>32:24</a></td><td class=td>所以我对他们说，凡有金环的，可以摘下来，他们就给了我。我把金环扔在火中，这牛犊便出来了。<br>So I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>32:25</a></td><td class=td>摩西见百姓放肆，(因为亚伦纵容他们，使他们在仇敌中间被讥刺，)<br>And when Moses saw that the people were without restraint (for Aaron had let them be without restraint to be a derision among those who rise up against them),</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>32:28</a></td><td class=td>利未的子孙照摩西的话行了；那一天百姓中被杀的约有三千。<br>And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and that day about three thousand men among the people fell.</td></tr>
