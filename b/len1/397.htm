<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>30:2</a></td><td class=td>因为王和众首领，并耶路撒冷全会众已经商议，要在二月守逾越节；<br>For the king and his officers and all the congregation in Jerusalem had taken counsel to hold the Passover in the second month,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>30:3</a></td><td class=td>正月间他们不能守，因为使自己分别为圣的祭司尚不敷用，百姓也没有聚集在耶路撒冷。<br>Because they could not hold it at that time, for the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number nor had the people gathered to Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>30:4</a></td><td class=td>王与全会众都以这事为美。<br>And the matter seemed right in the sight of the king and in the sight of all the congregation.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>30:16</a></td><td class=td>他们遵着神人摩西的律法，照例站在自己的地方；祭司从利未人手里接过血来，洒在坛上。<br>And they stood at their station after their custom, according to the law of Moses, the man of God: The priests sprinkled the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>30:17</a></td><td class=td>会中有许多人尚未使自己分别为圣，所以利未人为一切不洁之人宰逾越节的羊羔，使他们圣别归耶和华。<br>For there were many in the congregation who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites were charged with slaughtering the passover sacrifices for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Jehovah.</td></tr>
