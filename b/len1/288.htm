And Jehovah said, It is because of Saul and because of  his house of bloodshed, for he put those Gibeonites to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>21:2</a></td><td class=td>原来这基遍人不是以色列人，乃是亚摩利人中所剩的；以色列人曾向他们起誓，不杀灭他们，扫罗却为以色列人和犹大人发热心，想要杀灭他们。大卫王召了基遍人来，<br>So the king called for the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel but were of the remnant of the Amorites, and the children of Israel had sworn to them. But Saul had sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>21:3</a></td><td class=td>对他们说，我当为你们怎样行？可用什么遮罪，使你们为耶和华的产业祝福？<br>And David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And how shall I make expiation that you may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>21:4</a></td><td class=td>基遍人对他说，我们和扫罗与他家的事并不关乎金银，我们也不愿以色列中有一个人被处死。大卫说，你们怎样说，我就为你们怎样行。<br>And the Gibeonites said to him, It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul and his house, and it is not for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, Whatever you say I will do for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>21:5</a></td><td class=td>他们对王说，那从前毁坏我们，谋害我们，要灭绝我们，使我们不得在以色列全境内立足的人，<br>Then they said to the king, The man who consumed us and who made plans against us to destroy us so that we would not remain within any of the territory of Israel,</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>21:7</a></td><td class=td>王因为自己与扫罗的儿子约拿单之间，曾有指着耶和华所起的誓，就爱惜扫罗的孙子，约拿单的儿子米非波设，不交出来，<br>But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath of Jehovah that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>21:9</a></td><td class=td>交在基遍人的手里。基遍人就把他们，在耶和华面前悬挂在山上，这七人就一同死亡。他们被处死的时候，正是收割日子的起头，就是动手割大麦的时候。<br>And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites. And they hanged them on the mountain before Jehovah, and the seven perished together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of the barley harvest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>21:10</a></td><td class=td>爱雅的女儿利斯巴用麻布为自己铺在磐石上，从动手收割的时候，直到天降雨在尸身上的时候，日间不容空中的飞鸟落在尸身上，夜间不让田野的走兽前来蹧践。<br>And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it on a rock for herself, from the beginning of harvest until rain from heaven fell on their bodies; and she did not allow the birds of heaven to come upon them by day or the beasts of the field by night.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>21:12</a></td><td class=td>大卫就去，从基列雅比居民那里，将扫罗的骸骨和他儿子约拿单的骸骨搬了来；原来非利士人从前在基利波杀扫罗，将尸身悬挂在伯珊的街市上，基列雅比居民把尸身从那里偷了去。<br>And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day when the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>21:13</a></td><td class=td>大卫将扫罗的骸骨和他儿子约拿单的骸骨，从那里搬上去；众人把被悬挂七人的骸骨收殓了，<br>So he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>21:14</a></td><td class=td>将扫罗和他儿子约拿单的骸骨葬在便雅悯地的洗拉，在扫罗父亲基士的坟墓里；他们行了王所吩咐的。此后神应允国民为那地所恳求的。<br>And they buried the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin in Zela, in the grave of Kish his father; and they did all that the king had commanded. And God responded to the entreaty for the land after that.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>21:17</a></td><td class=td>但洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛帮助大卫，击打那非利士人，将他杀死。那时，跟随大卫的人向大卫起誓说，以后你不可再与我们一同出战，免得你使以色列的灯熄灭了。<br>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him and struck down the Philistine and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, saying, You shall not go forth with us again into battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>21:18</a></td><td class=td>后来，以色列人又在歌伯与非利士人打仗；户沙人西比该杀了巨人的一个后代撒弗。<br>Then after this there was war again with the Philistines at Gob; and Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was  one of the children of the giant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>21:19</a></td><td class=td>以后在歌伯又与非利士人打仗；伯利恒人雅雷俄珥金的儿子伊勒哈难杀了迦特人歌利亚，这人的枪杆粗如织布的机轴。<br>And there was war with the Philistines, again at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite, slew Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</td></tr>
