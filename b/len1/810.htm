<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>8:1</a></td><td class=td>第六年六月初五日，我坐在家中，犹大的众长老坐在我面前，在那里主耶和华的手临到我身上。<br>And in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth of the month, as I sat in my house and the elders of Judah sat before me, the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell upon me there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>我观看，见有一形像，仿佛火的样子：从祂腰以下有火的样子，从祂腰以上有光辉的样子，看来像光耀的金银合金。<br>Then I looked, and there was a likeness like the appearance of fire: from His loins and downward, the appearance of fire; and from His loins and upward something like the appearance of brightness, like the sight of electrum.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>祂伸出一只手的样式，抓住我的一绺头发；灵就将我举到天地之间，在神的异象中，带我到耶路撒冷朝北的内院门口，在那里有触动主妒忌之偶像的座位，就是惹动妒忌的。<br>And He stretched out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and heaven and brought me to Jerusalem in the visions of God, to the entrance of the gate of the inner court that faces north, where the seat of the idol of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>8:4</a></td><td class=td>在那里有以色列神的荣耀，显出来的样子与我在平原所见的一样。<br>And the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance that I saw in the plain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>祂对我说，人子阿，你举目向北观看。我就举目向北观看，见祭坛门的北边，在门口有这触动主妒忌的偶像。<br>Then He said to me, Son of man, Lift up your eyes now toward the north. Thus I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and there, toward the north at the altar gate, was this idol of jealousy at the entry.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>祂又对我说，人子阿，以色列家所行的，就是在这里行这大大可憎的事，使我远离我的圣所，你看见了么？你还要看见更大可憎的事。<br>And He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here, that I should be far from My sanctuary? But you will yet see greater abominations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>祂领我到院门口；我观看，见墙上有一洞。<br>Then He brought me to the entrance of the court; and I looked, and there was a hole in the wall.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>祂对我说，人子阿，你要挖墙。我一挖墙，见有一门。<br>And He said to me, Son of man, dig now through the wall. So I dug through the wall, and there was now an entrance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>8:9</a></td><td class=td>祂说，你进去，看他们在这里所行邪恶可憎的事。<br>And He said to me, Go and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>我进去观看，见四面墙上雕　各样爬物和可憎走兽的像，并以色列家一切的偶像。<br>Thus I entered and looked, and there were every form of creeping thing and detestable beast and all the idols of the house of Israel, engraved on the wall all around.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>8:11</a></td><td class=td>在这些像前有以色列家的长老七十人站立，沙番的儿子雅撒尼亚也站在其中，各人手里拿着自己的香炉，烟云的香气上腾。<br>And standing before them were seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each with his censer in his hand and the smell of the incense cloud went up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>8:12</a></td><td class=td>祂对我说，人子阿，以色列家的长老，各人在雕像屋里暗中所行的，你看见了么？因他们说，耶和华看不见我们；耶和华已经离弃这地。<br>And He said to me, Do you see, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each in the room of his engraved images? For they say, Jehovah does not see us; Jehovah has forsaken the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>8:13</a></td><td class=td>祂又说，你还要看见他们行更大可憎的事。<br>And He said to me, You will yet again see greater abominations that they are committing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>8:14</a></td><td class=td>于是祂领我到耶和华殿外院朝北的门口；在那里有妇女坐着，为搭模斯哭泣。<br>Then He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah that was toward the north; and women weeping for Tammuz were sitting there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>8:15</a></td><td class=td>祂对我说，人子阿，你看见了么？你还要看见比这些更大可憎的事。<br>And He said to me, Do you see, son of man? You will yet again see greater abominations than these.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>祂又领我到耶和华殿的内院；在耶和华的殿门口，在廊子和祭坛之间，约有二十五个人，背向耶和华的殿，面向东方；他们正朝着东方拜日头。<br>Then He brought me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah; and there, at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>祂对我说，人子阿，你看见了么？犹大家在这里行这些可憎的事，岂是小事么？他们又使这地满了强暴，再三惹我发怒，看哪，他们手拿枝条举向鼻前。<br>And He said to me, Do you see this, son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they also fill the land with violence and again and again provoke Me to anger? And now they are putting the branch to their nose.</td></tr>

My eye will not pity, nor will I spare; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not listen to them.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
