<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>18:1</a></td><td class=td>当时，门徒到耶稣跟前来，说，谁在诸天的国里是最大的？<br>In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>18:2</a></td><td class=td>耶稣便叫一个小孩子来，站在他们中间，说，<br>And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>18:3</a></td><td class=td>我实在告诉你们，你们若不回转，变成像小孩子一样，绝不能进诸天的国。<br>And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>18:4</a></td><td class=td>所以凡降卑自己像这小孩子的，这人在诸天的国里就是最大的。<br>He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>18:7</a></td><td class=td>世界因着绊跌人的事有祸了；绊跌人的事是免不了的，但那绊跌人的有祸了。<br>Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>18:8</a></td><td class=td>若是你的手或你的脚绊跌你，就把它砍下来扔掉；你残废或瘸腿进入生命，比有两手两脚被扔在永火里更好。<br>If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>18:17</a></td><td class=td>他若不听他们，就告诉召会；他若连召会也不听，就把他当作外邦人和税吏。<br>And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>18:18</a></td><td class=td>我实在告诉你们，凡你们在地上捆绑的，必是在诸天之上已经捆绑的；凡你们在地上释放的，必是在诸天之上已经释放的。<br>Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>18:19</a></td><td class=td>我又实在告诉你们，你们中间若有两个人在地上，在他们所求的任何事上和谐一致，他们无论求什么，都必从我在诸天之上的父，得着成全。<br>Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens. </td></tr>
