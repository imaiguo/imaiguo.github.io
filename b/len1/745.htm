<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>66:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和华如此说，天是我的座位，地是我的脚凳；你们要在那里为我建造殿宇？那里是我安息的地方？<br>Thus says Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, And the earth the footstool for My feet. Where then is the house that you will build for Me,  And where is the place of My rest?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>66:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和华说，这一切都是我手所造的，所以就都有了；但我所看顾的，就是灵里贫穷痛悔、因我话战兢的人。<br>For all these things My hand has made, And so all these things have come into being, declares Jehovah. But to this kind of man will I look, to him who is poor And of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>66:3</a></td><td class=td>宰牛的好像杀人的；献羊羔的好像打折狗颈的；献素祭的好像献猪血的；烧乳香的好像颂赞偶像的。这等人拣选自己的道路，魂里喜悦他们那些可憎恶的事；<br>He who kills an ox is like him who slays a man; He who sacrifices a lamb, like him who breaks a dog's neck; He who offers a meal offering is like him who offers the blood of swine; He who burns incense is like him who blesses an idol. As surely as they have chosen their own ways, And their soul delights in their abominations;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>66:4</a></td><td class=td>我也必拣选那愚弄他们的事，使他们所惧怕的临到他们；因为我呼唤，无人答应；我说话，他们不听从；反倒行我眼中看为恶的，拣选我所不喜悦的。<br>Just as surely I will choose what will treat them ill, And I will bring upon them what they dread; Because I called, but no one  answered; I spoke, but they did not listen; But they did evil in My sight, And chose that in which I did not delight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>66:5</a></td><td class=td>你们因耶和华言语战兢的人，当听祂的话：你们的弟兄，就是恨恶你们，因我名赶出你们的，曾说，愿耶和华得荣耀，使我们得见你们的喜乐；但蒙羞的乃是他们。<br>Hear the word of Jehovah, You who tremble at His word: Your brothers who hate you, Who cast you out because of My name, said, Let Jehovah be glorified So that we may see your joy. But they will be put to shame.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>66:6</a></td><td class=td>有喧哗的声音出自城中！有声音出于殿中！是耶和华向祂仇敌施行报应的声音。<br>A voice of tumult from the city! A voice from the temple! The voice of Jehovah giving full Recompense to His enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>66:7</a></td><td class=td>她未曾劬劳，就生产；未觉疼痛，就生出男孩。<br>Before she travailed, She brought forth; Before her pain came, She gave birth to a man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>66:8</a></td><td class=td>一地的民岂能一日而生？一国的人岂能一时而产？因为锡安一劬劳，便生下儿女；这样的事，谁曾听见？谁曾看见？<br>Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a land be born in one day? Or can a nation be brought forth all at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, She brought forth her children.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>66:9</a></td><td class=td>耶和华说，我既使她临产，岂不使她生产呢？你的神说，我既是使她生产的，岂能使她闭胎不生呢？<br>Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth? Says Jehovah. Or shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb? Says your God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>66:10</a></td><td class=td>你们爱耶路撒冷的，都要与她一同喜乐，且要因她欢腾；你们为她悲哀的，都要与她一同乐上加乐；<br>Be joyful with Jerusalem and exult for her, All you who love her; Rejoice with her in joy, All you who mourn over her,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>66:11</a></td><td class=td>使你们在她安慰的怀中吃奶得饱，使你们得她丰盛的荣耀，犹如挤奶，满心喜乐。<br>So that you may nurse and be  satisfied With her breasts of consolations, So that you may draw out from her and take excellent delight In the abundance of her glory.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>66:12</a></td><td class=td>耶和华如此说，我要使平安延及她，好像江河；使列国的荣耀延及她，如同涨溢的河；你们要从中咂奶；你们必蒙抱在肋旁，摇弄在膝上。<br>For thus says Jehovah, I now am extending to her Peace like a river, And the glory of the nations Like an overflowing stream; And you will nurse, you will be carried on the hip, And you will be bounced on the knees.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>66:13</a></td><td class=td>人怎样受母亲安慰，我就照样安慰你们；你们也必在耶路撒冷得安慰。<br>As one whom his mother comforts, So will I comfort you; And you will be comforted in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>66:14</a></td><td class=td>你们看见，心就快乐，你们的骨头必得滋润，像嫩草一样；而且耶和华的仆人必得知祂手所行的，祂也要向仇敌发恼恨。<br>And you will see this, and your heart will rejoice, And your bones will flourish like new grass; And the hand of Jehovah will be made known to His servants, And He will be indignant toward His enemies.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>66:15</a></td><td class=td>看哪，耶和华必在火中来临；祂的车辇像旋风，以烈怒施行报应，以火焰施行斥责；<br>For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, And His chariots will be like a whirlwind, To render His anger with fury And His rebuke with flames of  fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>66:16</a></td><td class=td>因为耶和华在一切有血肉的人身上，必以火与刀施行审判；被耶和华所杀的必甚多。<br>For with fire Jehovah will execute judgment, And with His sword, upon all flesh; And those slain by Jehovah will be many.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>66:17</a></td><td class=td>那些分别为圣，洁净自己的，进入园内跟在其中一个人的后头，吃猪肉和可憎之物并老鼠，他们必一同灭绝，这是耶和华说的。<br>Those who sanctify and purify themselves for the gardens, Following after one in the midst, Eating swine's flesh And what is abominable and even mice, Will come to an end together, declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>66:18</a></td><td class=td>至于我，我必对他们的行为和他们的意念施行报应；时候将到，我必将各邦国各方言的人聚来；他们必来看我的荣耀。<br>But I-their works and their thoughts I will repay; the time is coming to gather all the nations and tongues; and they will come and see My glory.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>66:19</a></td><td class=td>我要在他们中间显神迹，又从他们中间把逃脱的人差到列国去，就是到他施、弗和路德那些拉弓的人那里，到土巴和雅完，到素来没有听见我名声，没有看见我荣耀的辽远海岛；他们必将我的荣耀传扬在列国中。<br>And I will set a sign among them and will send those who have escaped from them unto the nations: to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, to those who draw the bow; to Tubal and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have not heard My fame nor seen My glory; and they will declare My glory among the nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>66:20</a></td><td class=td>他们必用马、用车、用轿、用骡子、用独峰驼，将你们所有的弟兄，从列国送到我的圣山耶路撒冷，作为素祭献给耶和华，好像以色列人用洁净的器皿把素祭奉到耶和华的殿中；这是耶和华说的。<br>And they will bring all your brothers from all the nations as a meal offering to Jehovah, on horses and in chariots and in wagons and on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain, Jerusalem, says Jehovah, just as the children of Israel bring their meal offering in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>66:23</a></td><td class=td>每逢月朔、安息日，凡有血肉的必来在我面前下拜；这是耶和华说的。<br>And from new moon to new moon And from Sabbath to Sabbath All flesh will come To bow down before Me, says Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>66:24</a></td><td class=td>他们必出去观看那些违背我之人的尸首；因为他们的虫是不死的，他们的火是不灭的；凡有血肉的，都必憎恶他们。<br>Then they will go forth and look On the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; For their worm will not die, Nor will their fire be quenched; And they will be an abhorrence to all flesh.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
