<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>27:12</a></td><td class=td>且因这港口不适于过冬，大多数的人就主张从那里开船，或者能到非尼喀过冬。非尼喀是革哩底的一个港口，一面朝东北，一面朝东南。<br>And as the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority gave counsel to put out to sea from there, if somehow they might be able to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing northeast and southeast, and spend the winter there. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>27:13</a></td><td class=td>这时微微起了南风，他们以为对目的地已有把握，就起锚，贴近革哩底航行。<br>And when a south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete close inshore. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>27:14</a></td><td class=td>但过了不久，一股名叫友拉革罗的狂风，从岛上扑下来，<br>But not long afterward there beat down from the island a hurricane wind called Euraquilo. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>27:15</a></td><td class=td>船被风抓住，敌不住风，我们就任风刮去，<br>And when the ship was caught by it and was not able to face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>27:17</a></td><td class=td>既把小艇拉上来，就用缆绳捆绑船底；又恐怕撞在赛耳底沙滩上，就放下帆来，任船飘流。<br>And when they had hoisted it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. And because they feared that they might run aground on Syrtis, they lowered the gear and so were driven along. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>27:18</a></td><td class=td>我们被风浪颠簸得很厉害，第二天众人就把货物抛出去，<br>The next day, as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo; </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>27:25</a></td><td class=td>所以诸位，要放心振作，我信神怎样对我说，事情也要怎样成就。<br>Therefore, cheer up, men, for I believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been spoken to me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>27:26</a></td><td class=td>只是我们必撞在一个岛上。<br>But we must run aground on a certain island. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>27:27</a></td><td class=td>到了第十四天夜里，我们在亚底亚海飘来飘去，约到半夜，水手以为渐近旱地，<br>But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about the middle of the night the sailors suspected that some land was approaching them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>27:28</a></td><td class=td>就探探深浅，探得有二十噚；稍往前行，又探探深浅，探得有十五噚。<br>And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they sounded again and found it to be fifteen fathoms. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>27:29</a></td><td class=td>恐怕撞在石头上，就从船尾抛下四个锚，期待着天亮。<br>And fearing that we might run aground somewhere on rocky places, they threw four anchors from the stern and wished for day to come. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>27:30</a></td><td class=td>水手想要离船逃走，就把小艇放在海里，假作要从船头抛锚的样子。<br>And when the sailors sought to flee from the ship, having lowered the small boat into the sea under pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>27:31</a></td><td class=td>保罗对百夫长和兵丁说，这些人若不留在船上，你们必不能得救。<br>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>27:32</a></td><td class=td>于是兵丁砍断小艇的绳子，任它飘去。<br>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the small boat and let it fall away. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>27:33</a></td><td class=td>从那时到天快亮，保罗一直劝众人用饭，说，你们悬望忍饿不吃什么，今天已是第十四天了。<br>And until day was about to come, Paul encouraged them all to take some food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued watching without food, taking nothing. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>27:34</a></td><td class=td>所以我劝你们用饭，这与你们的得救有关，因为你们各人连一根头发也不至于损坏。<br>Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your salvation; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>27:35</a></td><td class=td>保罗说了这话，就拿着饼，在众人面前感谢了神，然后擘开来吃。<br>And when he had said these things and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all; and he broke it and began to eat. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>27:36</a></td><td class=td>于是众人都放心振作，也就用饭了。<br>And all became cheerful, and they also took food. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>27:37</a></td><td class=td>我们在船上的，共有二百七十六个人。<br>Now we were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls in the ship. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>27:38</a></td><td class=td>他们吃饱了，就把麦子抛在海里，叫船轻一点。<br>And when they were satisfied with food, they began to lighten the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>27:39</a></td><td class=td>到了天亮，他们不认识那地方，只看见一个有岸可登的海湾，就商议能把船拢进去不能。<br>And when day came, they could not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay, which had a beach, into which they took counsel to drive the ship, if they were able. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=40>27:40</a></td><td class=td>于是把锚丢弃在海里，同时松开舵绳，拉起前帆，顺着风向岸驶去。<br>And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the bands of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the blowing of the wind, they held course for the beach. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=41>27:41</a></td><td class=td>但遇着两水夹流的地方，就把船搁了浅；船头胶着不动，船尾被浪猛力冲坏了。<br>But striking a sandbar with the sea on both sides, they ran the vessel aground; and the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was broken up by the violence of the waves. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=42>27:42</a></td><td class=td>兵丁的意思是要把囚犯杀了，恐怕有人泅水逃走；<br>And the counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest anyone swim away and escape; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=43>27:43</a></td><td class=td>但百夫长愿意叫保罗安全得救，不准他们任意而行，就吩咐会泅水的，跳下水去先上岸；<br>But the centurion, intending to bring Paul safely through, prevented them from their intention and ordered those who were able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get to the land, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=44>27:44</a></td><td class=td>其余的人，有的可以用木板，有的可以用船上的东西上岸。这样，众人都安全得救上了岸。<br>And the rest to follow, some on planks, and others on some of the things from the ship.
