<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>33:2</a></td><td class=td>我要差遣使者在你前面；我要撵出迦南人、亚摩利人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人。<br>And I will send an Angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>33:11</a></td><td class=td>耶和华与摩西面对面说话，好像人与同伴说话一般。摩西回到营里去，但他的帮手，一个少年人，就是嫩的儿子约书亚，不离开会幕。<br>And Jehovah would speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his companion.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>33:17</a></td><td class=td>耶和华对摩西说，你所说的这事我也要行；因为你在我眼前蒙了恩，并且我按你的名认识你。<br>And Jehovah said to Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight, and I know you by name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>33:18</a></td><td class=td>摩西说，求你将你的荣耀显给我看。<br>And he said, Please show me Your glory.</td></tr>
