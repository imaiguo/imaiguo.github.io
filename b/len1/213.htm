And He said, I caused you to go up out from Egypt, and I brought you into the land that I swore to your fathers. And I said, I will never break My covenant with you,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>你们也不可与这地的居民立约，要拆毁他们的祭坛。你们竟没有听从我的话。你们这作的是什么事？<br>And you shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars. But you did not listen to My voice. What is this that you have done?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>因此我又说，我必不将他们从你们面前赶出；他们必作你们肋下的荆棘；他们的神必作你们的网罗。<br>Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they will be like thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>并离弃耶和华，去事奉巴力和亚斯他录。<br>And they forsook Jehovah and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.</td></tr>

They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, the way of obeying the commandments of Jehovah; this they did not do.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>耶和华为他们兴起士师，就与那士师同在。那士师在世的一切日子，耶和华拯救他们脱离仇敌的手；他们因受人压迫欺凌，就哀声叹气，耶和华便怜恤他们。<br>And when Jehovah raised up judges for them, Jehovah was with the judge, and He saved them from the hand of their enemies throughout all the days of the judge; for Jehovah would be moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and crushed them.</td></tr>
