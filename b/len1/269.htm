And Jehovah said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And He said, To Hebron.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>大卫的仆人也过去十二名。他们彼此揪头，用刀刺肋，一同仆倒。所以，那地叫作希利甲哈素林，就在基遍。<br>And each seized his opponent by the head, and his sword  went into his opponent's side; and they fell down together.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>押尼珥又对亚撒黑说，你转开不要追赶我。我何必将你击杀在地呢？若那样，我怎能仰起脸见你哥哥约押呢？<br>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn away from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to Joab your brother?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>亚撒黑仍不肯转开；押尼珥就用枪尾刺入他的肚腹，甚至枪从背后透出，亚撒黑就仆倒在那里，当场死了。众人赶到亚撒黑仆倒而死的地方，就都站住。<br>But he refused to turn away, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the end of his spear; and the spear came out behind him.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>2:26</a></td><td class=td>押尼珥呼叫约押说，刀剑岂可永远吞灭人么？你岂不知终久必有苦楚么？你要等何时才叫百姓回去不追赶弟兄呢？<br>And Abner called out to Joab and said, Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? Then how long shall it be before you command the people to return from following their brothers?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>2:27</a></td><td class=td>约押说，我指着神的生存起誓，你若不说戏耍的那句话，今日早晨百姓就必上去，各人也不会追赶弟兄了。<br>And Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, then surely the people would have gone up each one from following his brother in the morning  only.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>2:28</a></td><td class=td>于是约押吹角，众民就站住，不再追赶以色列人，也不再打仗了。<br>And Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people stood still; and they pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight any more.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>2:29</a></td><td class=td>那一整夜，押尼珥和跟随他的人走过亚拉巴；他们过了约但河，又走过全毕伦，到了玛哈念。<br>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the Arabah. And they crossed over the Jordan and went through all the Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</td></tr>
