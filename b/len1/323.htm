For I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal. Whoever is missing will not live. But Jehu acted in subtlety, in order that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>10:21</a></td><td class=td>耶户差人走遍全以色列；凡事奉巴力的人都来了，没有剩下一个不来的。他们进了巴力庙，巴力庙中从这边到那边，都满了人。<br>And Jehu sent word throughout all Israel, and all the worshippers of Baal came; and there was not one left who did not come.
