<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>21:3</a></td><td class=td>说，耶和华以色列的神阿，今日以色列中缺了一支派，为何在以色列中发生这事呢？<br>And they said, Why, O Jehovah God of Israel, has this happened in Israel, that there is one tribe missing in Israel today?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>21:4</a></td><td class=td>次日百姓清早起来，在那里筑了一座坛，献燔祭和平安祭。<br>And in the morning the people rose early and built an altar there, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>21:8</a></td><td class=td>又彼此问说，以色列支派中谁没有上米斯巴到耶和华这里来呢？他们就查出基列雅比没有一人进营到会众那里；<br>And they said, Is there anyone from the tribes of Israel who did not come to Jehovah at Mizpah? Now there was no one from Jabesh-gilead who had come to the congregation at the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>21:9</a></td><td class=td>因为百姓被数点的时候，没有一个基列雅比的居民在那里。<br>For when the people were numbered, there was no one from among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>21:17</a></td><td class=td>又说，便雅悯逃脱的人当有地业，免得以色列中涂抹了一个支派。<br>And they said, There should be some possession for those of Benjamin who have escaped, that no tribe would be blotted out of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>21:18</a></td><td class=td>只是我们不能将自己的女儿给他们为妻；因为以色列人曾起誓说，那将女儿给便雅悯人为妻的，必受咒诅。<br>But we cannot give them any of our daughters as wives. For the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>21:19</a></td><td class=td>他们又说，看哪，在示罗年年有耶和华的节期。(示罗就在伯特利以北，从伯特利上示剑的大路以东，并利波拿以南。)<br>And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah each year in Shiloh (which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah).</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>21:20</a></td><td class=td>于是吩咐便雅悯人说，你们去，在葡萄园中埋伏；<br>And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>21:21</a></td><td class=td>你们观看，若见示罗的女子出来跳舞，就从葡萄园出来，在示罗的女子中各抢一个为妻，回便雅悯地去。<br>And right when you see the daughters of Shiloh coming out to dance in the dances, come out of the vineyards, and each of you shall catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh; then go into the land of Benjamin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>21:22</a></td><td class=td>他们的父亲或弟兄若来与我们争论，我们就对他们说，求你们施恩，将这些女子给我们，因我们在争战的时候没有给他们各留下妻子。这也不是你们将女子给他们的；若是你们给的，你们如今就有罪过。<br>And when their fathers or brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, Give them to us as a gift, for we did not take a wife in battle for each man, nor did you give them to them and thereby incur guilt for yourselves now.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>21:23</a></td><td class=td>于是便雅悯人照样而行，按着他们的数目从跳舞的女子中抢去为妻，就回自己的地业去，又重修城邑居住。<br>And the children of Benjamin did so and took wives, whom they carried off, according to their number from those who danced. And they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them.</td></tr>
