<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>31:5</a></td><td class=td>所以它高大超过田野诸树；发旺的时候，因得众水供应，所以枝子繁多，枝条长长。<br>Therefore its height was exalted Above all the trees of the field, And its boughs were multiplied, And its branches lengthened, Because of abundant waters, as it spread.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>31:6</a></td><td class=td>空中的飞鸟都在枝子上搭窝，田野的走兽都在枝条下生子，所有大国的人民都在它荫下居住。<br>All the birds of the sky Made their nests in its boughs, And all the beasts of the field Bore their young under its  branches, And in its shade All great nations dwelt.</td></tr>

I also made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted on account of it.</td></tr>

Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lowest parts of the earth; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those who were slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
