<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>7:1</a></td><td class=td>所以亲爱的，我们既有这些应许，就当洁净自己，除去肉身和灵一切的玷污，敬畏神，以成全圣别。<br>Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>你们要容纳我们，我们未曾亏负谁，未曾败坏谁，未曾占谁的便宜。<br>Make room for us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>我说这话，不是为定罪你们，因我先前说过，你们是在我们的心里，以至同死同活。<br>I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts for our dying together and our living together. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>我向你们大大的放胆，我为你们多多的夸口；我满得安慰，在我们一切的患难中，我格外的洋溢喜乐。<br>Great is my boldness toward you, great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>原来我们就是到了马其顿，我们的肉身也不得安宁，反而凡事遭患难，外有争战，内有惧怕。<br>For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted in everything; without were fightings, within were fears. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>但那安慰颓丧之人的神，借着提多来，安慰了我们；<br>But He who comforts those who are downcast, that is, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>不但借着他来，也借着他在你们身上所得的安慰，安慰了我们，因他把你们的切望、你们的哀恸、和你们为我的热心，都告诉了我们，叫我更加喜乐。<br>And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted because of you, declaring to us your longing, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>我虽曾写信叫你们忧愁，我并不懊悔；虽然我曾懊悔过，（因我晓得那信曾叫你们忧愁，尽管是一时的，）<br>For though I caused you sorrow by the letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did regret it (for I see that that letter, even if for an hour, caused you sorrow), </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>7:9</a></td><td class=td>如今我却喜乐，不是因你们忧愁，乃是因你们忧愁以致悔改，因为你们照着神忧愁，就不至于在任何事上，因我们受亏损了。<br>Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to God, that in nothing you might suffer loss from us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>因为照着神忧愁，生出悔改以致得救，是没有后悔的，但世上的忧愁是产生死亡。<br>For sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, which is without regret; but the sorrow of the world works out death. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>7:11</a></td><td class=td>且看这事，你们照着神忧愁，在你们中间已产生何等的热诚、甚而自诉、甚而愤恨、甚而惧怕、甚而切望、甚而热心、甚而责罚。在各方面，你们都证荐自己在那件事上是纯洁的。<br>For behold this very thing, your being made sorrowful according to God, what earnestness it has worked out in you, indeed what defense, indeed what indignation, indeed what fear, indeed what longing, indeed what zeal, indeed what punishment! In everything you have commended yourselves to be pure in the matter. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>7:12</a></td><td class=td>因此，我虽曾写信给你们，却不是为那亏负人的，也不是为那受亏负的，乃是为要在神面前，向你们显明你们对我们的热诚。<br>So then, though I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who was wronged, but for the sake of manifesting to you before God your earnestness for us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>7:13</a></td><td class=td>所以我们得了安慰，并且在这安慰之外，我们因提多的喜乐，就越发更加喜乐，因他的灵从你们众人得了畅快。<br>Because of this we have been comforted. And in addition to our comfort, we rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>因为我若对提多夸奖了你们什么，也不觉得羞愧。相反的，我们对你们所说的一切事，怎样是真实的，我们在提多面前所夸奖你们的，也怎样成了真实的。<br>For if in anything I boasted to him on your behalf, I have not been put to shame; on the contrary, as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boasting before Titus turned out to be the truth. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>并且提多想起你们众人的顺从，就是怎样恐惧战兢的接待他，他的心肠就越发倾向你们了。<br>And his affections are abundantly toward you, he remembering the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>我如今喜乐，能在凡事上为你们放心。<br>I rejoice that in everything I have boldness because of you. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
