<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>22:24</a></td><td class=td>我们行这事是有原因的，因为顾虑日后你们的子孙可能对我们的子孙说，你们与耶和华以色列的神有何相干呢？<br>But truly we have done this for a reason and out of a concern that in the future your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?</td></tr>
