<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>众祭司阿，现今这诫命是给你们的。<br>And now this commandment is for you, O priests.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>万军之耶和华说，你们若不听从，也不放在心上，将荣耀归与我的名，我就要差咒诅到你们中间，咒诅你们的福分；因你们不把诫命放在心上，我已经咒诅这些福分了。<br>If you will not hear and take it to heart to give glory to My name, says Jehovah of hosts, I will send the curse among you, and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have cursed them already because you have not taken it to heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>我必斥责你们的种子，又把粪，就是你们节期祭牲的粪，泼在你们的脸上；人要把你们与粪一同除掉。<br>I will rebuke your seed and spread dung upon your faces, the dung of your feasts; and they will take you away with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>你们就知道我传这诫命给你们，使我与利未所立的约，可以常存；这是万军之耶和华说的。<br>And you will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that My covenant may remain with Levi, says Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>我曾与他立生命和平安的约；我将这两样赐给他，使他心存敬畏；他就敬畏我，惧怕我的名。<br>My covenant was with him as life and peace; and I gave these to him that he might fear; and he did fear Me, and he did stand in awe of My name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>真理的律法在他口中，他嘴里没有不义；他在平安和正直里与我同行，使多人回头离开罪孽。<br>The law of truth was in his mouth, and no wrong was found in his lips; in peace and uprightness he walked with Me, and he turned many away from iniquity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>祭司的嘴当谨守知识，人也当由他口中寻求训诲，因为他是万军之耶和华的使者。<br>For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the mes- senger of Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>你们却偏离正道，使许多人在律法上跌倒；你们废弃我与利未所立的约；这是万军之耶和华说的。<br>But you have turned away from the way; you have caused many to stumble at the law; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>所以我也使你们在众人面前被藐视，看为下贱，因你们不遵行我的道路，竟在律法上偏袒人。<br>Therefore I also have made you despicable and base before all the people to the same extent that you have not kept My ways but have been respecters of persons in the law.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>我们岂不都有一位父么？岂不是一位神所造的么？我们各人怎么以诡诈待弟兄，渎犯了神与我们列祖所立的约呢？<br>Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why are we treacherous, each one to his brother, thus profaning the covenant of our fathers?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>犹大人行事诡诈，并且在以色列和耶路撒冷中，行了一件可憎的事；因为犹大人亵渎耶和华所爱的圣所，娶事奉外邦神的女子为妻。<br>Judah has been treacherous, and an abomination has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the  sanctuary of Jehovah, which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>凡行这事的，无论是叫醒的、答应的、或是献供物给万军之耶和华的，耶和华也必从雅各的帐棚中剪除他。<br>As regards the man who does this, Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob him who wakes and him who answers and him who offers a sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>你们又行了一件这样的事，使眼泪，使哭泣和叹息遮盖耶和华的祭坛，以致耶和华不再垂看那供物，也不乐意从你们手中收纳。<br>And this second thing you do: You cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping and sighing, so that He no longer regards the sacrifice or receives it with pleasure from your hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>你们还说，这是为什么呢？因耶和华在你和你幼年所娶的妻子中间作证人；她虽是你的伴侣，又是你盟约的妻子，你却以诡诈待她。<br>Yet you say, For what reason? Because Jehovah has been the witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been treacherous; yet she is your companion and your wife of covenant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>然而神岂不是使二人成为一么？祂灵的余裔是属祂的。为何成为一呢？乃是要得着属神的后裔。所以当谨守你们的灵，谁也不可以诡诈待自己幼年所娶的妻子。<br>But did He not make them one? And the remnant of the Spirit was His. And why the one? He sought the seed of God. Take heed then to your spirit, and let no one be treacherous to the wife of his youth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>耶和华以色列的神说，休妻是我所恨恶的，休妻的人是以强暴行事；所以当谨守你们的灵，不可行诡诈；这是万军之耶和华说的。<br>For I hate divorce, says Jehovah the God of Israel; and he who does it  behaves in violence, says Jehovah of hosts. Take heed then to your spirit, and do not be treacherous.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>你们用言语使耶和华厌烦；你们还说，我们在何事上使祂厌烦呢？因为你们说，凡行恶的，耶和华眼看为善，并且祂喜悦他们；或说，公平的神在那里呢？<br>You have wearied Jehovah with your words; but you say, How have we wearied Him? By saying, Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and He delights in them; or, Where is the God of justice?</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
