<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>约书亚从耶利哥打发人往伯特利东边，靠近伯亚文的艾城去；他对他们说，你们上去窥探那地。那些人就上去窥探艾城。<br>Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, east of Bethel; and he spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. So the men went up and spied out Ai.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>他们回到约书亚那里，对他说，众民不必都上去，大约二三千人上去就能攻下艾城；不必劳累众民都去，因为那里的人少。<br>And they returned to Joshua and said to him, Not all the people need go up; let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people labor there, for the  enemies are few.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>于是民中约有三千人上那里去，竟在艾城的人面前逃跑了。<br>So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled before the men of Ai.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>艾城的人击杀了他们约三十六人，从城门前追赶他们，直到示巴琳，在下坡击败他们；众民的心就融化如水。<br>And the men of Ai struck some of them, about thirty-six men; and they pursued them from before the gate unto Shebarim and struck them on the slope. And the heart of the people melted and became like water.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>约书亚便撕裂衣服，他和以色列的长老在耶和华的约柜前，面伏于地，直到晚上；他们也把尘土撒在头上。<br>And Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the ground upon his face before the Ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>约书亚说，哀哉！主耶和华阿，你为什么竟领这百姓过约但河，将我们交在亚摩利人的手中，使我们灭亡呢？我们不如住在约但河那边倒好。<br>And Joshua said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all? To give us over into the hand of the Amorites and cause us to perish? If only we had been content to dwell across the Jordan!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>主阿，以色列人既在仇敌面前转背逃跑，我还有什么可说的呢？<br>Oh, Lord, what can I say after Israel has turned its back before its enemies?</td></tr>

Then what will You do for Your great name?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>耶和华对约书亚说，起来，你为何这样面伏于地？<br>Then Jehovah said to Joshua, Rise up! Why have you fallen upon your face?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>7:11</a></td><td class=td>以色列人犯了罪，违背了我所吩咐他们的约，取了当灭的物；又偷窃，又行诡诈，又把那当灭的物放在他们的物件中。<br>Israel has sinned. Indeed they have trespassed My covenant, which I commanded them; indeed they have taken of that which was devoted to destruction; indeed they have stolen; indeed they have been deceptive; indeed they have put it among their goods.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>7:12</a></td><td class=td>因此，以色列人在仇敌面前站立不住；他们在仇敌面前转背逃跑，是因成了当灭的；你们若不把当灭的物从你们中间毁掉，我就不再与你们同在了。<br>Thus the children of Israel are not able to stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, for they have become something devoted to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy that which was devoted to destruction from among you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>7:13</a></td><td class=td>你起来，叫百姓分别为圣，说，你们要使自己分别为圣，豫备明天，因为耶和华以色列的神这样说，以色列阿，你们中间有当灭的物，非等到你们把那当灭的物从你们中间除掉，你们在仇敌面前必站立不住。<br>Rise up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, There is something devoted to destruction among you, O Israel; you will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove that which was devoted to destruction from among you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>到了早晨，你们要按着支派近前来；耶和华所取的支派，要按着家族近前来；耶和华所取的家族，要按着家室近前来；耶和华所取的家室，要按着男丁，一个一个的近前来。<br>Therefore in the morning you shall be brought near by your tribes; and the tribe which Jehovah takes shall draw near family by family; and the family which Jehovah takes shall draw near house by house; and the house which Jehovah takes shall draw near warrior by warrior.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>被取的人有当灭的物在他那里，他和他所有的必被火焚烧；因他违背了耶和华的约，又因他在以色列中行了愚妄的事。<br>And he who is taken with that which was devoted to destruction shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has trespassed the covenant of Jehovah and because he has committed folly in Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>于是约书亚清早起来，使以色列人按着支派近前来，取出来的是犹大支派；<br>So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>7:18</a></td><td class=td>使撒底的家室，按着男丁，一个一个的近前来，就取出犹大支派的人谢拉的曾孙，撒底的孙子，迦米的儿子亚干。<br>And he brought the  house of Zabdi near warrior by warrior, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>7:19</a></td><td class=td>约书亚对亚干说，我儿，我劝你将荣耀归给耶和华以色列的神，向祂认罪，将你所作的事告诉我，不要向我隐瞒。<br>And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give glory to Jehovah the God of Israel, and  make confession to Him. And tell me what you have done; do not hide anything from me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>7:20</a></td><td class=td>亚干回答约书亚说，我实在得罪了耶和华以色列的神。我所作的事是这样：<br>Then Achan answered Joshua and said, It is true; I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel; and this is what I did:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>7:21</a></td><td class=td>我在所夺的财物中，看见一件美好的示拿衣服、二百舍客勒银子、一条金子重五十舍客勒，我贪图这些物件，便拿去了。这些物件现今藏在我帐棚内的地里，银子在衣服底下。<br>When I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle of Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And now they are hidden in the earth in my tent, with the silver under it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>7:22</a></td><td class=td>约书亚就打发使者跑到亚干的帐棚里。那件衣服果然藏在他帐棚内，银子在底下。<br>And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. And there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>7:23</a></td><td class=td>他们就把那些物件从帐棚里取出来，拿到约书亚和以色列众人那里，摆在耶和华面前。<br>And they took the things from within the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and spread them out before Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>7:24</a></td><td class=td>约书亚和以色列众人把谢拉的曾孙亚干和那银子、那件衣服、那条金子，并亚干的儿子、女儿、牛、驴、羊、帐棚、以及他所有的，都带上亚割谷去。<br>Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah and the silver and the mantle and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his donkeys and his sheep and his tent and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>7:25</a></td><td class=td>约书亚说，你为什么叫我们遭祸呢？今日耶和华必叫你遭祸。于是以色列众人用石头打死他和他所有的，并将这一切用火焚烧。<br>And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? Jehovah will trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire when they had stoned them with stones.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>7:26</a></td><td class=td>众人在亚干身上堆成一大堆石头，直存到今日。于是耶和华转意，不发祂的烈怒。因此那地方名叫亚割谷，直到今日。<br>Then they erected over him a great heap of stones, which is there to this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
