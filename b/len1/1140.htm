<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>7:1</a></td><td class=td>这麦基洗德，撒冷王，至高神的祭司，就是那当亚伯拉罕杀败诸王回来的时候，迎接他，并给他祝福的。<br>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>7:2</a></td><td class=td>亚伯拉罕也将所得的一切，分了十分之一给他。首先，他的名字翻出来是公义王；其次，他又是撒冷王，就是平安王。<br>To whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>7:3</a></td><td class=td>他无父，无母，无族谱，既无时日之始，也无生命之终，乃与神的儿子相似，是永久为祭司的。<br>Being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>7:4</a></td><td class=td>你们要想想，先祖亚伯拉罕把上等掳物中的十分之一给他，这人是何等尊大！<br>And consider how great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>7:5</a></td><td class=td>那些领受祭司职任的利未子孙，奉命照着律法从百姓，就是从他们的弟兄，收取十分之一，尽管他们的弟兄是从亚伯拉罕腰中出来的；<br>And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>7:6</a></td><td class=td>但那不与他们同谱系的，倒收取亚伯拉罕的十分之一，并为那蒙受应许的祝福。<br>But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>7:7</a></td><td class=td>向来都是卑小的蒙尊优的祝福，这是一无可驳的。<br>But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>7:8</a></td><td class=td>在这里，收取十分之一的，是必死的人；在那里，却是那被证实为活着的。<br>And here men, who die, receive tithes; but there, one of whom it is testified that he lives. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>7:9</a></td><td class=td>并且可以这样说，那收取十分之一的利未，也是借着亚伯拉罕纳了十分之一；<br>And, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, he who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>7:10</a></td><td class=td>因为麦基洗德迎接亚伯拉罕的时候，利未还在他祖宗的腰中。<br>For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>7:11</a></td><td class=td>这样，借着利未人的祭司职分，若真能使人得完全，（百姓原是根据这职分领受了律法，）又何需另外兴起一位祭司，照着麦基洗德的等次，不照着亚伦的等次来称谓？<br>If indeed then perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what need was there still that a different Priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec and that He should not be said to be according to the order of Aaron? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>7:12</a></td><td class=td>祭司的职分既已更换，律法也必须更换。<br>For since the priesthood is transferred, of necessity there comes into being a transfer of law also. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>7:13</a></td><td class=td>因为这些话所说到的人，原有分于别的支派，那支派里没有一人伺候过祭坛。<br>For He of whom these things are said belongs to a different tribe, from which no one has attended to the altar. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>7:14</a></td><td class=td>我们的主明显是从犹大支派出来的；论到这支派，摩西并没有讲到祭司的事。<br>For it is evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah, concerning which tribe Moses spoke nothing about priests. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>7:15</a></td><td class=td>既然照麦基洗德的样式，兴起一位不同的祭司来，我们的话就更是显然的了；<br>And it is still more abundantly evident since it is according to the likeness of Melchisedec that a different Priest arises, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>7:16</a></td><td class=td>祂成了祭司，不是照着属肉之诫命的律法，乃是照着不能毁坏之生命的大能；<br>Who has been appointed not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>7:17</a></td><td class=td>因为有为祂作见证的说，“你是照着麦基洗德的等次，永远为祭司。”<br>For it is testified, "You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>7:18</a></td><td class=td>一面是先前的诫命，因其软弱和无益，而被废掉，<br>For there is, on the one hand, the setting aside of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>7:19</a></td><td class=td>（律法原来一无所成，）另一面却在其上引进更美的盼望，借此我们可以亲近神。<br>(For the law perfected nothing), and, on the other hand, the bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>7:20</a></td><td class=td>再者，耶稣为祭司，既不是不起誓立的，<br>And inasmuch as He was not made a Priest without the taking of an oath </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>7:21</a></td><td class=td>（那些人为祭司，原不是起誓立的，耶稣却是起誓立的，是借着那对祂说，“主起了誓绝不后悔，你是永远为祭司”的，）<br>(For they are appointed priests without the taking of an oath, but He, with the taking of an oath by Him who said to Him, "The Lord has sworn and will not regret it, You are a Priest forever''), </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>7:22</a></td><td class=td>祂就成了更美之约的保证。<br>By so much Jesus has also become the surety of a better covenant. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>7:23</a></td><td class=td>那些为祭司的，人数众多，是因为有死拦阻，不能长久；<br>And they are appointed priests many in number because death prevents them from continuing; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>7:24</a></td><td class=td>但耶稣既是永远长存的，祂就有不能更换的祭司职分。<br>But He, because He abides forever, has His priesthood unalterable. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>7:25</a></td><td class=td>所以，那借着祂来到神面前的人，祂都能拯救到底；因为祂是长远活着，为他们代求。<br>Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>7:26</a></td><td class=td>像这样圣而无邪恶、无玷污、与罪人分别，并且高过诸天的大祭司，原是与我们合宜的；<br>For such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners and having become higher than the heavens, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>7:27</a></td><td class=td>祂不像那些大祭司，每天必须先为自己的罪，再为百姓的罪献上祭物，因为祂献上自己，就把这事一次永远的作成了。<br>Who does not have daily need, as the high priests do, to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for those of the people; for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>7:28</a></td><td class=td>律法本是立软弱的人为大祭司，但在律法以后所起誓的话，却是立儿子为大祭司，乃是成全直到永远的。<br>For the law establishes men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which was after the law, establishes the Son, perfected forever. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
