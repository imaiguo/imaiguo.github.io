<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>过了十四年，我同巴拿巴，也带着提多，再上耶路撒冷去。<br>Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me also. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>我是照着启示上去的，把我在外邦人中所传的福音，对他们陈述；只是私下对那些有名望的人说；惟恐我现在，或是从前，徒然奔跑。<br>And I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the gospel which I proclaim among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of repute, lest perhaps I should be running, or had run, in vain. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>但与我同去的提多，虽是希利尼人，也没有被勉强受割礼；<br>But not even Titus, who was with me, though he is a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>因为有偷着引进来的假弟兄，他们偷着进来，要窥探我们在基督耶稣里所得的自由，为要强制我们作奴隶；<br>And this, because of the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>我们就是一刻的工夫，也没有容让服从他们，为要使福音的真理存留在你们中间。<br>To them we yielded with the subjection demanded not even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>至于那些有名望的，不论他们从前是何等人，于我都没有差别；神不以外貌取人；那些有名望的，并没有加给我什么；<br>But from those who were reputed to be something -- whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not accept man's person; for to me those who were of repute added nothing. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>反倒看见我受托传福音给那未受割礼的人，正如彼得受托传福音给那受割礼的人，<br>But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel to the circumcision, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>（因为那在彼得里面运行，叫他为受割礼之人尽使徒职分的，也在我里面运行，叫我为外邦人尽使徒的职分，）<br>(For He who operated in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcision operated also in me for the Gentiles), </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>又知道所赐给我的恩典，那被视为柱石的雅各、矶法、约翰，就向我和巴拿巴伸出右手彼此相交，叫我们往外邦人那里去，他们却往受割礼的人那里去；<br>And perceiving the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and to Barnabas the right hand of fellowship that we should go to the Gentiles, and they, to the circumcision. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>只是要我们记念穷人，这也是我本来热诚去行的。<br>Only they requested that we remember the poor, which very thing I was also eager to do. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>但矶法来到安提阿的时候，因他有可定罪之处，我就当面抵挡他。<br>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>因为从雅各那里来的几个人，未到以先，他惯常和外邦人一同吃饭；及至他们来到，他因怕奉割礼的人，就开始退去，隔离自己。<br>For before some came from James, he continually ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to shrink back and separate himself, fearing those of the circumcision. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>其余的犹太人，也都随着他装假；甚至连巴拿巴也被牵引，和他们一同装假。<br>And the rest of the Jews also joined him in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away in their hypocrisy. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>但我一看见他们不按福音的真理正直而行，就在众人面前对矶法说，你既是犹太人，若是生活像外邦人，不像犹太人，怎么还勉强外邦人犹太化？<br>But when I saw that they were not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like the Jews? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>我们是生来的犹太人，并不是出于外邦的罪人，<br>We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>且知道人得称义，不是本于行律法，乃是借着信耶稣基督，连我们也信入了基督耶稣，使我们本于信基督得称义，不是本于行律法；因为凡属肉体的人，都不能本于行律法得称义。<br>And knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>我们若寻求在基督里得称义，自己却也显为罪人，这样，基督岂不是叫人犯罪的么？绝对不是。<br>But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found sinners, is then Christ a minister of sin? Absolutely not! </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>因为我所拆毁的，若再建造，就证明自己是个有过犯的人。<br>For if I build again the things which I have destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>我借着律法，已经向律法死了，叫我可以向神活着。<br>For I through law have died to law that I might live to God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>我已经与基督同钉十字架；现在活着的，不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着；并且我如今在肉身里所活的生命，是我在神儿子的信里，与祂联结所活的，祂是爱我，为我舍了自己。<br>I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>2:21</a></td><td class=td>我不废弃神的恩；因为义若是借着律法得的，基督就是白白死了。<br>I do not nullify the grace of God; for if righteousness is through law, then Christ has died for nothing. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
