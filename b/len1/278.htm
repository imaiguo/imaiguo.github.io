<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>11:1</a></td><td class=td>到了年初，列王出战的时候，大卫差派约押和跟随他的臣仆，并以色列全军出战；他们歼毁亚扪人，围攻拉巴。但大卫仍住在耶路撒冷。<br>And at the turn of the year, at the time when kings go forth  to battle, David sent out Joab and his servants with him and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>11:2</a></td><td class=td>一日，傍晚时分，大卫从床上起来，在王宫的平顶上散步，从平顶上看见一个妇人沐浴，容貌甚美。<br>And late one afternoon David rose from his bed and went for a walk on the roof of the king's house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>11:3</a></td><td class=td>大卫就差人打听那妇人是谁。有人说，她不是别人，乃是以连的女儿，赫人乌利亚的妻子拔示巴。<br>And David sent and inquired about the woman. And someone said, This is none other than Bath-sheba the daughter of Eliam  and wife of Uriah the Hittite.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>11:4</a></td><td class=td>大卫差使者去，将妇人接来；她来了，大卫就与她同房。(那时她的月经才得洁净。)事后她回家去了。<br>And David sent messengers and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had just purified herself from her uncleanness.) And she returned to her house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>11:5</a></td><td class=td>后来妇人怀了孕，就打发人去告诉大卫说，我怀了孕。<br>And the woman conceived; and she sent  word and told David and said, I am pregnant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>11:6</a></td><td class=td>大卫差人到约押那里，说，你打发赫人乌利亚到我这里来。约押就打发乌利亚去见大卫。<br>Then David sent  word to Joab: Send me Uriah the Hittite. So Joab sent Uriah to David.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>11:7</a></td><td class=td>乌利亚来了，大卫问约押好，也问众兵好，又问争战的事怎样。<br>And Uriah came to him, and David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the battle was going.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>11:8</a></td><td class=td>大卫对乌利亚说，你下到家里去，洗洗脚罢。乌利亚出了王宫，随后王送他一分食物。<br>And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. And Uriah went forth from the king's house, and there followed him a present from the king.</td></tr>

Then David said to Uriah, Have you not just come from a journey? Why have you not gone down to your house?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>11:11</a></td><td class=td>乌利亚对大卫说，约柜和以色列与犹大兵都住在棚里，我主约押和我主的仆人都在田野安营；我岂可回家吃喝，与妻子同寝呢？我指着王和王的性命起誓，我绝不行这事！<br>And Uriah said to David, The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in huts, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live and your soul lives, I shall by no means do this thing!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>11:12</a></td><td class=td>大卫对乌利亚说，你今日仍住在这里，明日我才打发你去。于是乌利亚那日和次日住在耶路撒冷。<br>And David said to Uriah, Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you  back. So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the following.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>11:13</a></td><td class=td>大卫召请乌利亚来，叫他在自己面前吃喝，使他喝醉。到了晚上，乌利亚出去与他主的仆人一同住宿，并没有下到自己家里去。<br>Then David invited him to eat and drink in his presence, and he made him drunk.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>11:14</a></td><td class=td>次日早晨，大卫写信与约押，交乌利亚亲手带去。<br>Then in the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent  it by the hand of Uriah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>11:15</a></td><td class=td>信内写着说，要派乌利亚到战事最激烈的前方，你们便退后，使他被击杀而死。<br>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Put Uriah in the forefront of the hardest battle, and withdraw from him that he may be struck down and die.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>11:16</a></td><td class=td>于是约押在围城的时候，知道敌人那里有勇士，便将乌利亚派在那里。<br>So when Joab besieged the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew the valiant men were.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>11:17</a></td><td class=td>城里的人出来和约押打仗；民中有几个大卫的仆人阵亡了，赫人乌利亚也死了。<br>And the men of the city went forth and fought with Joab; and some of the people, some of the servants of David, fell. And Uriah the Hittite died also.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>11:18</a></td><td class=td>约押差人去将争战的一切事告诉大卫；<br>And Joab sent  a messenger to tell David all the things concerning the battle;</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>11:21</a></td><td class=td>从前打死耶路比设儿子亚比米勒的是谁呢？岂不是一个妇人从城墙上抛下一块上磨石来，打在他身上，他就死在提备斯么？你们为什么挨近城墙呢？你就说，你的仆人赫人乌利亚也死了。<br>Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman throw an upper millstone upon him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so close to the wall? Then you shall say, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>11:22</a></td><td class=td>使者就去了；他来见大卫，将约押打发他去说的一切话奏告大卫。<br>So the messenger went, and he came and told David all that Joab had sent him for.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>11:23</a></td><td class=td>使者对大卫说，敌人强过我们，出到郊野与我们打仗，但我们追杀他们，直到城门口。<br>And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>11:24</a></td><td class=td>射箭的从城墙上射王的仆人，射死几个；你的仆人赫人乌利亚也死了。<br>Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall, and some of the king's servants died. And your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>11:25</a></td><td class=td>大卫对使者说，你对约押这样说，不要因这事难过，刀剑或吞灭这人或吞灭那人，没有一定的；你只管竭力攻城，将城倾覆。你要用这话勉励约押。<br>Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you say to Joab, Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your fighting against the city and overthrow it. And encourage him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>11:26</a></td><td class=td>乌利亚的妻子听见丈夫乌利亚死了，就为他哀哭。<br>And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</td></tr>
