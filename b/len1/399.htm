And he encamped against the fortified cities and intended to break into them for himself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>32:2</a></td><td class=td>希西家见西拿基立来，定意要攻打耶路撒冷，<br>And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that his face was set to fight against Jerusalem,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>32:3</a></td><td class=td>就与首领和勇士商议，塞住城外的水泉；他们就都帮助他。<br>He took counsel with his officers and mighty men to stop the water of the fountains that were outside the city, and they helped him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>32:4</a></td><td class=td>于是有许多人聚集，塞了一切水泉，并通流那地的小河，说，亚述诸王来，为何让他们得着许多水呢？<br>So many people gathered together and stopped all the fountains and the brook that flowed through the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find an abundance of water?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>32:5</a></td><td class=td>希西家奋勇自强，修筑所有拆毁的城墙，在城墙上立起城楼，并且在城外另筑一城墙；他又坚固大卫城的米罗，制造了许多兵器、盾牌。<br>And he took courage and built up all the wall that was broken down and  erected towers on it and built another wall outside; and he strengthened the Millo in the city of David and made weapons and shields in abundance.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>32:8</a></td><td class=td>与他们同在的是肉臂，与我们同在的却是耶和华我们的神，祂帮助我们，为我们争战。百姓就靠犹大王希西家的话，安然无惧了。<br>With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles. And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah the king of Judah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>32:10</a></td><td class=td>亚述王西拿基立如此说，你们倚靠什么，还留在耶路撒冷受困呢？<br>Thus says Sennacherib the king of Assyria, In what are you trusting, that you remain in a siege in Jerusalem?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>32:11</a></td><td class=td>希西家对你们说，耶和华我们的神必救我们脱离亚述王的手，这不是诱劝你们，使你们受饥渴而死么？<br>Is not Hezekiah trying to persuade you to give yourselves up to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>32:12</a></td><td class=td>这希西家岂不是曾将耶和华的邱坛和祭坛废去，且吩咐犹大与耶路撒冷的人说，你们当在一个坛前敬拜，在其上烧香么？<br>Was it not the same Hezekiah who took away His high places and His altars and who commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar you shall worship, and upon it shall you burn incense?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>32:13</a></td><td class=td>我与我列祖向各地众民所行的，你们岂不知道么？各地列邦的神何尝能救自己的地脱离我的手呢？<br>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>32:15</a></td><td class=td>所以现在不要让希西家这样欺哄诱劝你们，也不要信他；因为没有任何一邦一国的神，能救自己的民脱离我的手和我列祖的手；何况你们的神，更不能救你们脱离我的手！<br>Now therefore do not let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way, and do not believe him; for there is no god of any nation or kingdom who was able to deliver his people out of my hand and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>32:16</a></td><td class=td>西拿基立的臣仆还说了别的话，攻击耶和华神和祂的仆人希西家。<br>And his servants said still more against Jehovah God and against Hezekiah His servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>32:17</a></td><td class=td>西拿基立也写信辱骂耶和华以色列的神，攻击祂，说，各地列邦的神怎样不能救自己的民脱离我的手，希西家的神也照样不能救自己的民脱离我的手。<br>And he wrote letters to cast contempt on Jehovah the God of Israel and to speak against Him, saying, Like the gods of the nations of the lands that did not deliver their people out of my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people out of my hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>32:18</a></td><td class=td>亚述王的臣仆用犹大语向城墙上耶路撒冷的民大声呼叫，要使他们惧怕、惊惶，以便取城。<br>And they cried out in a loud voice in the Jews' language against the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall in order to frighten them and terrify them, so that they might take the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>32:19</a></td><td class=td>他们说话攻击耶路撒冷的神，如同攻击地上诸民的神，就是人手所造的神一样。<br>And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as they had against the gods of the peoples of the land, the work of men's hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>32:20</a></td><td class=td>希西家王和亚摩斯的儿子申言者以赛亚为此祷告，向天呼求。<br>But Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed about this, and they cried out to heaven.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>32:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和华就差遣一个使者，把亚述王营中所有大能的勇士、首领和将帅，尽都灭了。亚述王满面含羞的回到他的本地，进了他神的庙中，他亲生的几个儿子在那里用刀杀了他。<br>And Jehovah sent an angel, who annihilated all the mighty men of valor and the leaders and the captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he entered the house of his god, some of those who had come forth from his bowels felled him there with the sword.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>32:22</a></td><td class=td>这样，耶和华救了希西家和耶路撒冷的居民，脱离亚述王西拿基立的手，也脱离一切仇敌的手，并且四围护卫了他们。<br>Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and out of the hand of everyone, and He  protected them on all sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>32:23</a></td><td class=td>有许多人到耶路撒冷，将供物献与耶和华，又将宝物送给犹大王希西家，以致希西家从此在列邦人的眼中看为尊高。<br>And many brought gifts to Jehovah at Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiah the king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all the nations thereafter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>32:24</a></td><td class=td>那些日子，希西家病得要死，就祷告耶和华；耶和华对他说话，赐他一个兆头。<br>In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill, and he prayed to Jehovah. And He spoke to him and gave him a sign.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>32:25</a></td><td class=td>希西家却没有照他所受的好处报答耶和华，因他心里高傲；故此忿怒要临到他和犹大并耶路撒冷。<br>But Hezekiah did not respond according to the benefit  he had received, for his heart was  proud; therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>32:26</a></td><td class=td>但希西家和耶路撒冷的居民自觉心里高傲，就一同自卑，以致耶和华的忿怒在希西家的日子，没有临到他们。<br>But Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah did not come again upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>32:27</a></td><td class=td>希西家大有财富和尊荣，为自己建造府库，收藏金银、宝石、香料、盾牌、和各样的珍宝；<br>Now Hezekiah had very much wealth and honor, and he made for himself treasuries for silver and gold and precious stones and for spices and shields and all kinds of valuable goods,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>32:28</a></td><td class=td>又建造仓房，收藏所出产的五谷、新酒和新油，又为各类牲口盖棚，为羊群筑圈。<br>As well as storehouses for produce of grain and new wine and fresh oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and flocks in sheepfolds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>32:29</a></td><td class=td>并且为自己建造城邑，还获得许多的羊群牛群，因为神赐他极多的财产。<br>And he built cities and acquired many flocks and herds, for God had given him very many possessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>32:30</a></td><td class=td>这希西家也塞住基训水流的上泉，引水直下，流在大卫城的西边。希西家所作的事尽都亨通。<br>And it was this Hezekiah who stopped the upper spring of the water of Gihon and directed it down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>32:31</a></td><td class=td>惟有一件事，就是巴比伦王侯的使者奉差遣来见希西家，访问那地所发生的奇事；在这件事上神离弃他，要试验他，好知道他心中的一切。<br>So also in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the wonders that had happened in the land, God forsook him only to test him and know all that was in his heart.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>32:32</a></td><td class=td>希西家其余的事和他所行忠信的事，都写在犹大、以色列的诸王记上，亚摩斯的儿子申言者以赛亚的异象书中。<br>And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of faithfulness are there written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>32:33</a></td><td class=td>希西家与他列祖同睡，人将他葬在大卫子孙墓地的高坡；他死的时候，犹大众人和耶路撒冷的居民，都向他致敬。他儿子玛拿西接续他作王。<br>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper part of the tombs of David's sons; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
