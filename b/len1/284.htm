<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>17:14</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙和以色列众人说，亚基人户筛的计谋比亚希多弗的计谋更好；这是因耶和华命定要破坏亚希多弗的良谋，为要使灾祸临到押沙龙。<br>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel; for Jehovah had ordained the defeat of the good counsel of Ahithophel to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>17:21</a></td><td class=td>他们走后，二人从井里上来，就去告诉大卫王。他们对大卫说，亚希多弗如此如此定谋害你们，你们务要起来，快快过溪。<br>And after they departed, they came up out of the well and went and told King David. And they said to David, Rise up and cross quickly over the water, for thus has Ahithophel given counsel against you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>17:22</a></td><td class=td>于是大卫和跟随他的众人都起来，过约但河；到了天亮，没有剩下一人不过约但河的。<br>So David rose up with all the people who were with him, and they crossed over the Jordan; by morning's light there was not one left who had not crossed over the Jordan.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>17:23</a></td><td class=td>亚希多弗见他的计谋不被采纳施行，就备上驴，起来往本城本家去；他安顿了家，便上吊死了，葬在他父亲的坟墓里。<br>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and rose up and went to his house in his city; and he set his house in order and hanged himself.

Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in unto Abigail the daughter of Nahash, Zeruiah's sister, Joab's mother.</td></tr>
