<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>26:1</a></td><td class=td>西弗人到基比亚见扫罗，说，大卫不是在荒野前的哈基拉山藏着么？<br>And the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, David is hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite the desert!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>26:2</a></td><td class=td>扫罗就起身，带领以色列的三千精兵，下到西弗的旷野，要在那里寻索大卫。<br>And Saul rose up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, with him three thousand choice men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>26:3</a></td><td class=td>扫罗在荒野前的哈基拉山，在路旁安营。大卫住在旷野，听说扫罗跟着他来到旷野，<br>And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite the desert, by the road. And David remained in the wilderness, but he saw that Saul had come into the wilderness after him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>26:4</a></td><td class=td>就打发人去探听，便知道扫罗果然来到。<br>And David sent spies and knew for certain that Saul had come.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>26:5</a></td><td class=td>大卫起来，到扫罗安营的地方，察看扫罗和他的元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥躺卧之处；扫罗睡在辎重营里，百姓安营在他周围。<br>So David rose up and went to the place where Saul encamped. And David looked on the place where Saul and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army, lay. Now Saul was lying within the entrenchment, and the people were encamped around him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>26:6</a></td><td class=td>大卫对赫人亚希米勒和洗鲁雅的儿子约押的兄弟亚比筛说，谁同我下到营里，到扫罗那里去？亚比筛说，我同你下去。<br>And David responded and spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai the son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul at the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>26:7</a></td><td class=td>于是大卫和亚比筛夜间到了百姓那里，见扫罗睡卧在辎重营里；他的枪在头旁，插在地上。押尼珥和百姓躺卧在他周围。<br>So David and Abishai went to the people by night; and there lay Saul, sleeping within the entrenchment, and his spear was stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people lay around him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>26:8</a></td><td class=td>亚比筛对大卫说，今日神将你的仇敌交在你手里了，现在求你让我拿枪将他刺透在地，一刺就成，不用再刺。<br>And Abishai said to David. God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore let me strike him with the spear even to the ground with one stroke, and I will not do it twice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>26:9</a></td><td class=td>大卫对亚比筛说，不可杀害他；有谁伸手害耶和华的受膏者而无罪呢？<br>But David said to Abishai, Do not destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against Jehovah's anointed and be guiltless?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>26:10</a></td><td class=td>大卫又说，我指着永活的耶和华起誓，他或是被耶和华击打，或是他的日子到了而死，或是下到战场阵亡；<br>And David said, As Jehovah lives, Jehovah will strike him down, or his day will come to die, or he will go down in battle and perish.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>26:11</a></td><td class=td>我在耶和华面前，万不敢伸手害耶和华的受膏者。现在你可以将他头旁的枪和水瓶拿来，我们就走。<br>Jehovah forbid that I should stretch out my hand against Jehovah's anointed. Now therefore take the spear that is by his head and the water jug, and let us go.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>26:12</a></td><td class=td>大卫从扫罗的头旁拿了枪和水瓶，二人就走了，没有人看见，没有人知道，也没有人醒起，都睡着了，因为耶和华使他们沉沉的睡了。<br>So David took the spear and the water jug by Saul's head, and they went away. And no one saw  it or knew about  it, nor did anyone awake, for all of them were sleeping; for a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>26:13</a></td><td class=td>大卫过到那边去，远远的站在山顶上，与他们相离甚远。<br>And David crossed over to the other side and stood on the top of the hill far off; a great distance was between them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>26:14</a></td><td class=td>大卫呼叫百姓和尼珥的儿子押尼珥，说，押尼珥阿，你不回答么？押尼珥回答说，你是谁，竟呼叫王呢？<br>And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Will you not answer, Abner? And Abner answered and said, Who are you that calls out to the king?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>26:15</a></td><td class=td>大卫对押尼珥说，你不是个大丈夫么？以色列中谁能比你呢？民中有一人进来要杀害王你的主，你为何没有保护王你的主呢？<br>And David said to Abner, Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>26:16</a></td><td class=td>你所作的这事是不好的。我指着永活的耶和华起誓，你们都是该死的；因为没有保护你们的主，就是耶和华的受膏者。现在你看看王头旁的枪和水瓶在那里。<br>This thing is not good that you have done. As Jehovah lives, you are as good as dead because you did not guard your lord, Jehovah's anointed. Now therefore, see where the king's spear and the water jug that were by his head are.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>26:17</a></td><td class=td>扫罗听出是大卫的声音，就说，我儿大卫，这是你的声音么？大卫说，我主我王阿，是我的声音；<br>And Saul recognized David's voice; and he said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>26:18</a></td><td class=td>又说，我主为什么竟追赶仆人呢？我作了什么？我手里有什么恶事？<br>And he said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>26:19</a></td><td class=td>现在求我主我王听仆人的话：若是耶和华激动你攻击我，愿耶和华收纳祭物；若是人激动你，愿他们在耶和华面前受咒诅；因为他们今日赶逐我，不容我在耶和华的产业上有分，说，你去事奉别神罢。<br>Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is Jehovah who has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it is the sons of men, let them be cursed before Jehovah; for they have driven me out today, so that I cannot share in Jehovah's inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>26:20</a></td><td class=td>现在求王不要使我的血流在离开耶和华之面的地；以色列王出来是寻找一只虼蚤，如同人在山上猎取鹧鸪一般。<br>Now therefore do not let my blood fall to the ground apart from the presence of Jehovah; for the king of Israel has come forth to seek a single flea, as one might hunt a partridge in the mountains.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>26:21</a></td><td class=td>扫罗说，我有罪了。我儿大卫，你回来罢，因你今日看我的性命为宝贵，我必不再加害你。我作了糊涂事，大大错了。<br>And Saul said, I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will not harm you anymore, because my life was precious in your sight this day. I have indeed acted foolishly and have made a very great mistake.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>26:22</a></td><td class=td>大卫回答说，王阿，你的枪在这里，可以吩咐一个少年人过来拿去<br>And David answered and said, Here is the spear, O king. Let one of the young men cross over and get it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>26:23</a></td><td class=td>耶和华必照各人的公义忠实报应他：今日耶和华将你交在我手里，我却不肯伸手害耶和华的受膏者；<br>And Jehovah will repay to each man his righteousness and faithfulness: Because Jehovah has delivered you into my hand today, and I would not stretch out my hand against Jehovah's anointed;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>26:24</a></td><td class=td>看哪，我今日怎样重看你的性命，愿耶和华也照样重看我的性命，拯救我脱离一切患难。<br>Then just as great as your life was in my eyes this day, so great may my life be in Jehovah's eyes that He would deliver me from all distress.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>26:25</a></td><td class=td>扫罗对大卫说，我儿大卫，愿你得福。你必有作为，也必得胜。于是大卫继续走他的路，扫罗也回他的本处去了。<br>And Saul said to David, Blessed are you, my son David. You shall most certainly both do and prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
