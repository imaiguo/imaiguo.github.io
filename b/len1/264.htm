<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>28:1</a></td><td class=td>那些日子，非利士人聚集军旅，要攻打以色列。亚吉对大卫说，你要清楚知道，你和跟随你的人都要随我出战。<br>Then in those days the Philistines gathered their camps together for war to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, Know assuredly that you shall go out with me into the camp, you and your men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>28:2</a></td><td class=td>大卫对亚吉说，既是如此，仆人所能作的事，王必知道。亚吉对大卫说，这样，我立你永远作我的护卫。<br>And David said to Achish, This being so, you will know what your servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore I will make you my bodyguard for life.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>28:3</a></td><td class=td>那时撒母耳已经死了，全以色列为他哀哭，将他埋葬在拉玛，就是在他本城里。扫罗曾将交鬼的和行巫术的人驱逐出境。<br>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him; and they had buried him in Ramah, that is, in his own city. And Saul had the mediums and the soothsayers put out of the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>28:4</a></td><td class=td>非利士人聚集，来到书念安营；扫罗将全以色列聚集起来，在基利波安营。<br>And the Philistines gathered together, and they came and encamped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>28:5</a></td><td class=td>扫罗看见非利士人的军旅就惧怕，心中大大发颤。<br>And when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>28:6</a></td><td class=td>扫罗求问耶和华，耶和华却不借梦、或乌陵、或申言者回答他。<br>And Saul inquired of Jehovah; but Jehovah did not answer him, not by dreams or by the Urim or by the prophets.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>28:7</a></td><td class=td>扫罗对臣仆说，当为我找一个交鬼的妇人，我好去问她。臣仆说，看哪，在隐多珥有一个交鬼的妇人。<br>Then said Saul to his servants, Seek for me a woman who is a medium that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, There is now a woman who is a medium at En-dor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>28:8</a></td><td class=td>于是扫罗改了装，穿上别的衣服，带着两个人，夜里去见那妇人。扫罗说，求你用交鬼的法术为我问吉凶，将我所告诉你的死人，为我招上来。<br>Then Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes. And he and two men with him went, and they came to the woman by night. And he said, Consult a departed spirit for me, and bring up to me the one whom I tell you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>28:9</a></td><td class=td>妇人对他说，看哪，你知道扫罗所作的，他已将交鬼的和行巫术的从这地剪除。你为何陷害我的性命，使我死呢？<br>But the woman said to him, Look, you know what Saul has done, that he has cut off the mediums and the soothsayers from the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life to make me die?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>28:10</a></td><td class=td>扫罗向妇人指着耶和华起誓说，我指着永活的耶和华起誓，你必不因这事受刑。<br>Then Saul swore to her by Jehovah, saying,  As Jehovah lives, no punishment shall happen to you for this thing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>28:11</a></td><td class=td>妇人说，我为你招谁上来呢？扫罗说，为我招撒母耳上来。<br>So the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to you? And he said, Bring up Samuel to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>28:12</a></td><td class=td>妇人看见撒母耳，就大声呼叫，对扫罗说，你是扫罗，为什么欺哄我呢？<br>Now when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>28:13</a></td><td class=td>王对妇人说，不要惧怕，你看见了什么？妇人对扫罗说，我看见有神明从地里上来。<br>And the king said to her, Do not be afraid. But what do you see? And the woman said to Saul, I see some divine being coming up out of the earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>28:14</a></td><td class=td>扫罗说，他是怎样的形状？妇人说，有一个老人上来，身穿长袍。扫罗知道是撒母耳，就屈身，面伏于地下拜。<br>And he said to her, What is his appearance? And she said, An old man is coming up; and he is wrapped in a cloak. Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with  his face to the ground and paid  him homage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>28:15</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳对扫罗说，你为什么搅扰我，招我上来？扫罗回答说，我甚窘急；因为非利士人攻击我，神也离开我，不再借申言者或梦回答我。因此我呼唤你，请你指示我应当怎样行。<br>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up? And Saul said, I am greatly distressed; for the Philistines wage war against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, neither through the prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>28:16</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳说，既然耶和华已经离开你，且与你为敌，你何必问我呢？<br>And Samuel said, Why then have you inquired of me? For Jehovah has turned away from you and become your adversary.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>28:17</a></td><td class=td>耶和华已经亲自照着祂借我所说的话行了；祂已经从你手里夺去国权，赐给与你亲近的人，就是大卫。<br>And Jehovah has done for Himself just as He spoke through me, for Jehovah has torn the kingdom out from your hand and given it to an associate of yours, to David.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>28:18</a></td><td class=td>因你没有听从耶和华的话，没有在亚玛力人身上执行祂的烈怒，所以今日耶和华向你行了这事。<br>Because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah and did not execute His burning anger upon the Amalekites, therefore Jehovah has done this thing to you this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>28:19</a></td><td class=td>耶和华也必将以色列同你交在非利士人的手里，明日你和你众子必与我在一处了；耶和华也必将以色列的军兵交在非利士人手里。<br>And Jehovah will also give Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me; Jehovah will also give the camp of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>28:20</a></td><td class=td>扫罗全身猛然仆倒在地，因撒母耳的话甚是惧怕；那一昼一夜没有吃什么，就毫无力气<br>Then immediately Saul fell his full length to the ground, and he was very afraid because of Samuel's words. And there was no strength in him, for he had not eaten food all day and all night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>28:21</a></td><td class=td>妇人到扫罗面前，见他极其惊惶，就对他说，看哪，婢女听了你的话；我不顾惜自己的性命，听了你对我所说的话。<br>And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was very troubled. And she said to him, Indeed, your servant has listened to your voice; and I have put my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>28:22</a></td><td class=td>现在求你也听婢女的话，让我在你面前摆上一点食物；你要吃，好有力气行路。<br>Now therefore, you listen also to the voice of your servant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>28:23</a></td><td class=td>扫罗不肯，说，我不吃。但他的仆人和妇人都勉强他，他才听了他们的话，从地上起来，坐在床上。<br>But he refused and said, I will not eat. Then his servants, as well as the woman, compelled him, and he listened to their voice; and he rose up from the ground and sat on the bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>28:24</a></td><td class=td>妇人家里有一只肥牛犊；她急忙将肥牛犊宰了，又拿面抟成无酵饼烤了，摆在扫罗和他仆人面前。他们吃完，当夜就起身走了。<br>And the woman had a fattened calf in the house; and she hurried and killed it, and took flour and kneaded  it, and baked unleavened bread with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>28:25</a></td><td class=td>摆在扫罗和他仆人面前。他们吃完，当夜就起身走了。<br>And she brought  it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. And they rose up and went away that night.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
