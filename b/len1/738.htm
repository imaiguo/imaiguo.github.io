<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>59:1</a></td><td class=td>耶和华的手臂并非缩短不能拯救；祂的耳朵并非发沉不能听见。<br>No, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save; Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>59:2</a></td><td class=td>但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝，你们的罪使祂掩面不听你们。<br>But your iniquities have become a separation Between you and your God, And your sins have hidden His face From you so that He does not hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>59:3</a></td><td class=td>因你们的手被血沾染，你们的指头被罪孽玷污；你们的嘴唇说虚谎之言，你们的舌头出不义之语。<br>For your hands are defiled with  blood, And your fingers with iniquity; Your lips have spoken falsehood, Your tongue has muttered  injustice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>59:4</a></td><td class=td>无一人按公义告状，无一人凭真实辨白；他们都倚靠虚妄，说谎言；所怀的是毒害，所生的是罪孽；<br>No one sues righteously, And no one pleads in truth; They trust in vanity and speak lies; They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>59:5</a></td><td class=td>他们菢毒蛇蛋，结蜘蛛网；人吃这蛋必死；这蛋破裂，必出蝮蛇；<br>They hatch adders' eggs And weave the spider's web; He who eats of their eggs dies, And that which is crushed breaks forth into a viper.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>59:6</a></td><td class=td>他们所结的网不能成为衣服，所作的也不能遮盖自己；他们的作为都是罪孽的作为，手中所作的都是强暴。<br>Their webs will not become  garments, Nor will they cover themselves with their works; Their works are works of iniquity, And an act of violence is in their palms.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>59:7</a></td><td class=td>他们的脚奔向邪恶，他们急速流无辜人的血；他们的意念都是罪孽的意念；在他们所经过的路上，尽是荒凉和毁坏。<br>Their feet run toward evil, And they hasten to shed innocent blood; Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; Desolation and destruction are in their highways.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>59:8</a></td><td class=td>平安的路，他们不知道；他们的行径中没有公平；他们使自己的路径弯曲；凡行在这路径上的，都不知道平安。<br>The way of peace they do not know, And there is no justice in their course; They have made their paths crooked; Whoever goes on it does not know peace.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>59:9</a></td><td class=td>因此公平远离我们，公义追不上我们；我们指望亮光，却是黑暗；指望光明，却行在幽暗中。<br>Therefore justice is far from us, And righteousness does not overtake us; We look eagerly for light, but, ah, darkness, For brightness, but we walk in gloom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>59:10</a></td><td class=td>我们摸索墙壁，好像瞎子；我们摸索，如同无目之人；我们晌午绊脚，如在黄昏一样；我们在肥壮人中，就像死人一般。<br>We grope like blind men at the wall; We grope like those without eyes; We stumble at midday as we would at dusk; Among the prospering we are like dead men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>59:11</a></td><td class=td>我们都咆哮如熊，不住哀鸣如鸽子；指望公平，却没有公平；指望救恩，救恩却远离我们。<br>All of us roar like bears And moan incessantly like doves; We look eagerly for justice, but there is none, For salvation, but it is far from us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>59:12</a></td><td class=td>因为我们的过犯在你面前增多，我们的罪作证告我们；过犯与我们同在；至于我们的罪孽，我们都知道；<br>For our transgressions are multiplied before You, And our sins respond to You against us; For our transgressions are with us, And as for our iniquities, we know what they are:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>59:13</a></td><td class=td>就是悖逆不认耶和华，转去不跟从我们的神；说欺压和叛逆的话，心怀谎言并且说出。<br>Transgressing and denying Jehovah, And turning away from our God; Speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>59:14</a></td><td class=td>公平转而退后，公义站在远处；真实在街上跌倒，正直也不得进入。<br>And justice is turned back, And righteousness stands far off; For truth has stumbled in the street, And uprightness cannot come in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>59:15</a></td><td class=td>真实少见，离开恶事的人反成掠物。耶和华看见没有公平，祂眼中以此为恶。<br>And truth is lacking, And he who turns from evil becomes plunder. And Jehovah saw it, and it was evil in His sight That there was no justice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>59:16</a></td><td class=td>祂见没有一人，祂诧异无人代求；就用自己的膀臂施行拯救，以公义扶持自己。<br>And He saw that there was no man, And He was appalled that there was no intercessor. Therefore His arm accomplished salvation for Him, And His righteousness sustained Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>59:17</a></td><td class=td>祂穿上公义如胸甲，头戴救恩的头盔，又穿上报仇为衣服，披上热心如外袍。<br>Thus He put on righteousness as a breastplate, And a helmet of salvation upon His head; And He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing And wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>59:18</a></td><td class=td>祂必按人的行为施报，将恼怒加给祂的敌人，将报应加给祂的仇敌，向众海岛施行报应。<br>According to their dealings, so will He repay: Wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; To the coastlands He will repay with recompense.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>59:19</a></td><td class=td>如此，人从日落之处，必敬畏耶和华的名，从日出之地，也必敬畏祂的荣耀；敌人好像河水冲来时，耶和华的灵必高举旌旗抵挡他。<br>So they will fear the name of Jehovah from the west, And His glory from the rising of the sun; When the adversary comes like a  flood, The Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a standard against him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>59:20</a></td><td class=td>必有一位救赎主来到锡安，来到雅各家中转离过犯的人那里；这是耶和华说的。<br>And a Redeemer will come to Zion, And unto those who turn from transgression in Jacob, Declares Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>59:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和华说，至于我，我与他们所立的约乃是这样：我加在你身上的灵，放在你口中的话，必不离你的口，也不离你后裔与你后裔之后裔的口，从今时直到永远；这是耶和华说的。<br>And as for Me, this is My covenant with them, says Jehovah: My Spirit which is upon you and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your seed, nor from the mouth of your seed's seed, says Jehovah, from now and forever.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
