<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>32:2</a></td><td class=td>雅各看见他们就说，这是神的军营，于是给那地方起名叫玛哈念。<br>And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's camp. So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>32:3</a></td><td class=td>雅各打发报信的人先往西珥地，以东乡间，见他哥哥以扫；<br>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>32:4</a></td><td class=td>他吩咐他们说，你们要对我主以扫这样说：你的仆人雅各这样说，我在拉班那里寄居，直留到如今。<br>And he commanded them, saying, Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>32:5</a></td><td class=td>我有牛、驴、羊群、仆人、婢女，现在打发人来报告我主，为要在你眼前蒙恩。<br>And I have oxen and donkeys and flocks, and male servants and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord this, that I may find favor in your sight.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>32:7</a></td><td class=td>雅各就甚惧怕，而且愁烦，便把那与他同在的人口和羊群、牛群、骆驼分作两队，<br>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two camps;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>32:8</a></td><td class=td>说，以扫若来击杀这一队，剩下的那一队还可以逃避。<br>And he said, If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp which is left will escape.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>32:9</a></td><td class=td>雅各说，耶和华我祖亚伯拉罕的神，我父亲以撒的神阿，你曾对我说，回你本地，到你亲族那里去，我要善待你。<br>Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who said to me, Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will do you good,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>32:10</a></td><td class=td>你向仆人所施的一切慈爱和信实，我一点也不配得；我先前只拿着我的杖过这约但河，如今我却成了两队。<br>I am not worthy of all the lovingkindnesses and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant, for with my staff only I crossed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>32:11</a></td><td class=td>求你救我脱离我哥哥以扫的手；因为我怕他来击杀我，连妻子带儿女一同击杀了。<br>Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and attack me, even the mother with the children.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>32:17</a></td><td class=td>又吩咐尽先走的说，我哥哥以扫遇见你的时候，问你说，你是那家的人？要往那里去？你前头这些牲畜是谁的？<br>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong? And where are you going? And whose animals are these before you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>32:18</a></td><td class=td>你就说，是你仆人雅各的，是送给我主以扫的礼物；他自己也在我们后边。<br>Then you will say, Your servant Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau; and now he also is behind us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>32:19</a></td><td class=td>又吩咐第二、第三、和一切赶群畜的人说，你们遇见以扫的时候，也要这样对他说；<br>And he commanded also the second and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, In this way you shall speak to Esau when you find him,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>32:20</a></td><td class=td>并且你们要说，你仆人雅各就在我们后边。因为雅各心里说，我借着在我前头去的礼物解他的恨，然后再见他的面，或者他会接纳我。<br>And you shall also say, Your servant Jacob is right behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>32:21</a></td><td class=td>于是礼物在他前头过去了；那夜，他在队中住宿。<br>So the present crossed over before him, and he himself spent that night in the camp.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>32:22</a></td><td class=td>他夜间起来，带着两个妻子，两个使女，并十一个儿子，过雅博渡口。<br>And he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two female servants and his eleven children and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>32:23</a></td><td class=td>他带着他们，打发他们过河，又打发所有的都过去。<br>And he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over what he had.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>32:24</a></td><td class=td>只剩下雅各一人，有一个人和他摔跤，直到黎明。<br>And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>32:25</a></td><td class=td>那人见自己胜不过他，就将他的大腿窝摸了一把；雅各正与那人摔跤的时候，他的大腿窝就脱了节。<br>And when the man saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob's hip was dislocated as he wrestled with Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>32:26</a></td><td class=td>那人说，天快亮了，让我去罢。雅各却说，你若不给我祝福，我就不让你去。<br>And the man said, Let Me go, for the dawn is breaking. But Jacob said, I will not let You go unless You bless me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>32:27</a></td><td class=td>那人对他说，你名叫什么？他说，我名叫雅各。<br>And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>32:28</a></td><td class=td>那人说，你的名不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列；因为你与神与人较力，都得了胜。<br>And He said, Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>32:29</a></td><td class=td>雅各问祂说，请将你的名告诉我。但那人说，你何必问我的名？于是祂在那里给雅各祝福。<br>And Jacob asked Him and said, Please tell me Your name. But He said, Why is it that you ask My name? And He blessed him there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>32:30</a></td><td class=td>雅各便给那地方起名叫毗努伊勒，因为他说，我面对面看见了神，我的性命仍得保全。<br>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for, he said, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been preserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>32:31</a></td><td class=td>日头升起，照在雅各身上，那时他渡过毗努伊勒，他的大腿就瘸了。<br>And the sun rose upon him as he crossed over Penuel, and he limped because of his hip.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>32:32</a></td><td class=td>故此，以色列人不吃大腿窝的筋，直到今日，因为那人摸了雅各大腿窝的筋。<br>Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the thigh muscle, which is upon the socket of the hip, to this day, because He touched the socket of Jacob's hip at the thigh muscle.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
