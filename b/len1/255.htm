<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>19:1</a></td><td class=td>扫罗对他儿子约拿单和众臣仆说，要杀大卫；扫罗的儿子约拿单却甚喜爱大卫。<br>And Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, took great delight in David.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>19:2</a></td><td class=td>约拿单告诉大卫说，我父亲扫罗想要杀你，所以明日早晨你要小心，留在隐密的地方，躲藏起来。<br>And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father is seeking to kill you. Now therefore be on guard in the morning, and stay in some secret place, and hide yourself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>19:3</a></td><td class=td>我就出到你躲藏的田里，站在我父亲旁边，与他谈论你的事；我看看情形怎样，就必告诉你。<br>And I will go out and stand by my father's side in the field where you are. And I will speak about you to my father; and if I learn anything, I will tell you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>19:4</a></td><td class=td>约拿单向他父亲扫罗说大卫的好话，说，王不可得罪王的仆人大卫，因为他未曾得罪你，他所行的都与你大有益处。<br>So Jonathan spoke well about David to Saul his father and said to him, May the king not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have been very good for you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>19:5</a></td><td class=td>他不顾性命杀那非利士人，耶和华就为全以色列大行拯救；那时你看见，也很欢喜，现在为何无故要杀大卫，犯流无辜人之血的罪呢？<br>For he risked his life when he struck down the Philistine, and Jehovah accomplished a great salvation for all Israel. You saw  it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by having David killed without cause?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>19:6</a></td><td class=td>扫罗听了约拿单的话，就起誓说，我指着永活的耶和华起誓，他必不至被处死。<br>And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore, As Jehovah lives, he shall not be put to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>19:7</a></td><td class=td>约拿单叫大卫来，把这一切事告诉他，约拿单带大卫去见扫罗，他就和以前一样，侍立在扫罗面前。<br>Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>19:8</a></td><td class=td>此后又有争战的事。大卫出去与非利士人打仗，大大杀败他们，他们就从他面前逃跑。<br>And there was war again. And David went out and fought against the Philistines. And he struck them with a great slaughter, and they fled from before him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>19:9</a></td><td class=td>从耶和华那里来的恶灵又降在扫罗身上；扫罗手里拿枪坐在屋里，大卫正用手弹琴。<br>Then there came an evil spirit from Jehovah upon Saul, and he sat in his house with his spear in his hand while David played  the lyre by hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>19:10</a></td><td class=td>扫罗用枪想要刺透大卫，钉在墙上；他却从扫罗面前躲开，扫罗的枪刺入墙内。当夜大卫逃走躲避了。<br>And Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul's presence. And Saul struck the wall with his spear, but David fled and escaped that night.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>19:11</a></td><td class=td>扫罗打发使者去大卫的房屋那里窥探他，要在第二天早晨杀他。大卫的妻子米甲对他说，你今夜若不逃命，明日你要被杀。<br>Then Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him and kill him in the morning. And Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If you do not save your life tonight, in the morning you will be killed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>19:12</a></td><td class=td>于是米甲将大卫从窗户里缒下去；大卫就离去，逃走躲避了。<br>So Michal let David down through the window, and he went away and fled and escaped.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>19:13</a></td><td class=td>米甲把家中的神像放在床上，把山羊毛织的网子放在像的头上，用衣服遮盖。<br>Then Michal took the teraphim and laid  it in the bed. And she put a net of goats' hair on its head and covered  it with clothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>19:14</a></td><td class=td>扫罗打发使者去捉拿大卫，米甲说，他病了。<br>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>19:15</a></td><td class=td>扫罗又打发使者去看大卫，说，当连床将他抬上我这里来，我好杀他。<br>And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me on his bed that I may kill him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>19:16</a></td><td class=td>使者进去，看见床上有神像，头上有山羊毛织的网子。<br>And when the messengers went in, there was the teraphim in the bed with a net of goats' hair on its head.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>19:17</a></td><td class=td>扫罗对米甲说，你为什么这样欺哄我，放走我的仇敌，使他逃脱呢？米甲对扫罗说，他对我说，你放我走，何必要我杀你呢？<br>Then Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go so that he has slipped away? And Michal said to Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>19:18</a></td><td class=td>大卫逃走脱身，来到拉玛见撒母耳，将扫罗向他所行的事都述说了。他和撒母耳就往拿约去居住。<br>So David fled and slipped away and came to Samuel at Ramah, and he told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt at Naioth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>19:19</a></td><td class=td>有人告诉扫罗说，大卫在拉玛的拿约。<br>Then it was told Saul, saying, David is now at Naioth in Ramah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>19:20</a></td><td class=td>扫罗打发使者去捉拿大卫。去的人见有一班申言者正在申言，撒母耳站着监管他们；神的灵临到扫罗的使者身上，他们就也申言。<br>So Saul sent messengers to seize David; and when they saw the company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing  and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's messengers, and they also prophesied.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>19:21</a></td><td class=td>有人将这事告诉扫罗，他又打发别的使者去，他们也申言。扫罗第三次再打发使者去，他们也申言。<br>And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul again sent messengers the third time, and they also prophesied.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>19:22</a></td><td class=td>然后扫罗自己也往拉玛去，到了西沽的大井，问人说，撒母耳和大卫在那里？有人说，在拉玛的拿约。<br>Then he himself went to Ramah. And he came to the great well that is in Secu; and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And someone said, They are now at Naioth in Ramah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>19:23</a></td><td class=td>他就往拉玛的拿约去。神的灵也临到他身上，他就一面走一面申言，直到拉玛的拿约。<br>So he went there, toward Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him as well, and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>19:24</a></td><td class=td>他也脱了衣服，并且在撒母耳面前申言，那一昼一夜露体躺卧。因此有话说，扫罗也在申言者中间么？<br>And he also stripped off his clothes and also prophesied before Samuel, and he lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
