<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>9:1</a></td><td class=td>我将这一切事放在心上，详细考究，就看明义人和智慧人，并他们的作为，都在神手中；或是爱，或是恨，人不能知道；一切都在他们的前面。<br>For all this I laid on my heart, so that I might explain all this, that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God; man knows neither love nor hate; all is before them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>9:2</a></td><td class=td>凡临到众人的事都是一样：义人和恶人，好人、洁净人和不洁净人，献祭的和不献祭的，所遭遇的都是一样。好人如何，罪人也如何；起誓的如何，怕起誓的也如何。<br>All things are alike to all: One thing happens to the righteous man and to the wicked man, to the good and to the clean and to the unclean, to him who sacrifices and to him who does not sacrifice; as the good man is, so is the sinner; he who swears is like him who fears an oath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>9:3</a></td><td class=td>在日光之下所行的一切事上有一祸患，就是众人所遭遇的都是一样；并且世人的心充满了恶；他们活着的时候心里狂妄，后来就归死人那里去了。<br>This is an evil among all that is done under the sun, that one thing happens to all; moreover the heart of the children of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live; and after that, they go to the dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>9:4</a></td><td class=td>与一切活人相连的，那人还有指望，因为活着的狗比死了的狮子更强。<br>For there is hope for whomever is joined to all the living-surely a living dog is better than a dead lion -</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>9:5</a></td><td class=td>活着的人知道自己必死；死了的人却毫无所知，也不再得赏赐；他们的名被人遗忘。<br>For the living know that they will die; but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>9:6</a></td><td class=td>他们的爱，他们的恨，他们的嫉妒，早都消灭了；在日光之下所行的一切事上，他们永不再有分了。<br>Their love, their hate, and their envy have already perished, nor do they have some portion yet in all that is done under the sun forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>9:7</a></td><td class=td>你只管去欢欢喜喜吃你的饭，心中快乐喝你的酒，因为神已经悦纳你的作为。<br>Go; eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>9:8</a></td><td class=td>你的衣服当时常洁白，你的头上也不要缺少膏油。<br>Let your garments always be white, and do not let oil be lacking on your head.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>9:9</a></td><td class=td>在你一生虚空的日子，就是神赐你在日光之下一切虚空的日子，当同你所爱的妻子，享受人生，因为那是你一生在日光之下劳碌的事上所得的分。<br>Enjoy life with the wife whom you have loved all the days of your life of vanity which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity; for this is your portion in life and in your labor by which you have labored under the sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>9:10</a></td><td class=td>凡你手所当作的事要尽力去作；因为在你所要去的阴间，没有工作，没有谋算，没有知识，也没有智慧。<br>Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, where you are going.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>9:11</a></td><td class=td>我又见日光之下快跑的未必能赢，力战的未必得胜，并且智慧的未必得粮食，聪明的未必得赀财，有知识的也未必得喜悦；所临到众人的，是在于时候和机会。<br>Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor is the battle to the mighty, nor is even the bread to the wise, nor are riches to those who have understanding, nor is favor to those who have knowledge; but time and chance happen to them all.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>9:12</a></td><td class=td>原来人也不知道自己的时候：鱼被恶网圈住，鸟被网罗捉住，祸患忽然临到的时候，世人陷在其中也是如此。<br>For also man does not know his time: Like fish that are caught in a  deadly net and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of men are ensnared in an evil time when it falls suddenly on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>9:13</a></td><td class=td>我也见日光之下有一件事乃是智慧，据我看是大的，<br>This also I have seen as wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>9:14</a></td><td class=td>就是有一小城，其中的人数稀少，有大君王来攻击，将城围困，修筑高垒攻打。<br>There was a small city with a few men in it; and a great king came against it and surrounded it and built great siegeworks against it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>9:15</a></td><td class=td>城中有一个贫穷的智慧人，他用智慧救了那城，却没有人记念那穷人。<br>And in it there was found a poor wise man, and he delivered the city by his wisdom; yet no one remembered that poor man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>9:16</a></td><td class=td>我就说，智慧胜过勇力；然而那贫穷人的智慧被人藐视，他的话也无人听从。<br>So I said, Wisdom is better than strength; but the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are not heard.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>9:17</a></td><td class=td>智慧人在安静中所说的话，比掌权者在愚昧人中的喊声更有人听。<br>The words of the wise man spoken quietly are heeded more than the shouting of a ruler among fools.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>9:18</a></td><td class=td>智慧胜过打仗的兵器；但一个罪人能败坏许多善事。<br>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
