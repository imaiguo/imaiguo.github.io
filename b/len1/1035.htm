<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>17:5</a></td><td class=td>但犹太人嫉妒起来，招聚了一些市井匪类，结伙成群，骚动那城，又闯进耶孙的家，想要将保罗、西拉带到民众那里；<br>But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some evil men from among the loafers in the marketplace, gathered a crowd and set the city in an uproar; and coming upon the house of Jason, they sought to bring them to the populace. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>17:18</a></td><td class=td>还有一些以彼古罗和斯多亚的哲学家，与他争论，有的说，这胡言乱语的想要说什么？有的说，他似乎是传说异邦鬼神的。这话是因保罗传扬耶稣与复活为福音。<br>And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also confronted him. And some said, What would this babbler wish to say? And others, He seems to be an announcer of foreign deities -- because he was announcing Jesus and the resurrection as the gospel. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>17:19</a></td><td class=td>他们就拉住保罗，把他带到亚略巴古，说，你所讲的这新教训是什么，我们可以知道么？<br>And they took hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is which is being spoken by you? </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>17:28</a></td><td class=td>因我们生活、行动、存留都在于祂，就如你们中间有些作诗的说，原来我们也是祂的族类。<br>For in Him we live and move and are, as even some poets among you have said, For we are also His race. </td></tr>
