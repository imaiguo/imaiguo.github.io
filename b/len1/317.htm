And the creditor has come to take my two children to himself as servants.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>以利沙问她说，我可以为你作什么呢？你告诉我，你家里有什么？<br>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house? And she said, Your servant has nothing at all in the house, except a jar of oil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>她说，婢女家中除了一瓶油之外，没有什么。以利沙说，你去，到外面向你众邻舍借空器皿，不要少借；<br>And he said, Go and borrow vessels outside, from all your neighbors, empty vessels, and not just a few.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>然后进屋里去，把自己和儿子关在门内，你要将油倒在所有的器皿里，倒满了的放在一边。<br>Then go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and each one you fill set aside.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>于是妇人离开以利沙去了，把自己和儿子关在门内；儿子把器皿拿给她，她就倒油。<br>So she went away from him and shut the door behind herself and her sons; and they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out into them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>4:6</a></td><td class=td>器皿都满了，她对儿子说，再给我拿器皿来。儿子说，再没有器皿了。油就止住了。<br>And when she had filled the vessels, she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. But he said to her, There is no other vessel. And the oil stopped.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>4:7</a></td><td class=td>妇人去告诉神人，神人说，你去卖油还债，所剩的，你和你儿子可以靠着度日。<br>And she went and told the man of God. And he said, Go and sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons can live off the rest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>4:8</a></td><td class=td>一日，以利沙经过书念，在那里有一个大户的妇人，强留他吃饭。<br>And one day Elisha was passing through Shunem; and there was a wealthy woman there, who compelled him to have a meal. So whenever he passed through, he would turn aside and have a meal there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>4:9</a></td><td class=td>此后，以利沙每从那里经过，就转进去吃饭。妇人对丈夫说，我看出那常从我们这里经过的是圣别的神人。<br>And she said to her husband, Now I know that this man who continually passes through unto us is a holy man of God.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>4:12</a></td><td class=td>以利沙对仆人基哈西说，你叫这书念妇人来。他就把妇人叫了来，妇人站在以利沙面前。<br>And he said to Gehazi his attendant, Call this Shunammite. And he called her, and she stood before him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>4:13</a></td><td class=td>以利沙告诉仆人，你对她说，你既为我们费了许多心思，有什么可以为你作的呢？有什么要替你向王或元帅说的么？她回答说，我在我本民中安居无事。<br>And he said to him, Say to her, You have gone to all this trouble for us; what can be done for you? Should you be spoken of to the king or to the captain of the army? And she said, I dwell in the midst of my people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>4:14</a></td><td class=td>以利沙对仆人说，究竟当为她作什么呢？基哈西说，她没有儿子，她丈夫也老了。<br>And he said, What then can be done for her? And Gehazi said, Indeed she has no son, and her husband is old.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>4:15</a></td><td class=td>以利沙说，再叫她来。于是基哈西叫了她来，她就站在门口。<br>Then he said, Call her. And he called her, and she stood at the door.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>4:16</a></td><td class=td>以利沙说，到明年这时候，你必抱一个儿子。她说，不会的，神人，我主阿，不要欺哄你的婢女。<br>And he said, At this time  next year you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, O man of God, do not deceive your servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>4:17</a></td><td class=td>妇人果然怀孕，到了次年那时候，生了一个儿子，正如以利沙对她所说的。<br>And the woman conceived and bore a son at that time the next year, as Elisha had told her.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>4:19</a></td><td class=td>他对父亲说，我的头阿！我的头阿！他父亲对仆人说，把他抱到他母亲那里。<br>And he said to his father, My head! My head! And he said to his attendant, Carry him to his mother.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>4:20</a></td><td class=td>仆人把他抱去，交给他母亲；孩子坐在母亲的膝上，到晌午就死了。<br>And when he had carried him in and brought him to his mother, the child lay upon her lap until noon, then died.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>4:22</a></td><td class=td>呼叫她丈夫说，请你打发一个仆人给我牵一匹驴来，我要快快的去见神人，就回来。<br>Then she called her husband and said, Send me one of the attendants and one of the donkeys that I may run to the man of God and return.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>4:23</a></td><td class=td>丈夫说，今日不是月朔，也不是安息日，你为何要去见他呢？妇人说，平安无事。<br>And he said, Why will you go to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the Sabbath. But she said, It will be fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>4:24</a></td><td class=td>于是她备上驴，对仆人说，你快快赶着走，我若没有告诉你，就不要为我慢下来。<br>Then she saddled the donkey and said to her attendant, Urge the beast, and do not restrain the ride for me unless I tell you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>4:25</a></td><td class=td>妇人就往迦密山去见神人。神人远远的看见她，就对仆人基哈西说，书念的妇人在那里。<br>So she went. And she came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. And when the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi his attendant, That is the Shunammite over there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>4:26</a></td><td class=td>你现在跑去迎接她，问她说，你平安么？你丈夫平安么？孩子平安么？她说，平安。<br>Run now to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child? And she said, It is well.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>4:27</a></td><td class=td>妇人来到山上神人那里，就抱住神人的脚。基哈西前来要推开她，但神人说，由她罢；因为她魂里愁苦，耶和华向我隐瞒，没有指示我。<br>And when she came to the man of God on the mountain, she clung to his feet. And Gehazi approached to pull her away, but the man of God said, Leave her alone; for she is bitter in soul, and Jehovah has hidden  from me and has not told me</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>4:28</a></td><td class=td>妇人说，我何尝向我主求过儿子呢？我岂没有说过，不要欺哄我么？<br>And she said, Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, Do not mislead me?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>4:29</a></td><td class=td>以利沙对基哈西说，你束上腰，手拿我的杖前去。若遇见人，不要向他问安；人若向你问安，也不要回答；要把我的杖放在孩子脸上。<br>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not respond to him. And lay my staff upon the face of the boy.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>4:30</a></td><td class=td>孩子的母亲说，我指着永活的耶和华和你的性命起誓，我必不离开你。于是以利沙起身，随着她去了。<br>And the mother of the boy said, As Jehovah lives and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he rose up and followed her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>4:31</a></td><td class=td>基哈西在他们前面先去，把杖放在孩子脸上，却没有声音，也没有动静。基哈西就迎着以利沙回来，告诉他说，孩子还没有醒过来。<br>And Gehazi passed on before them and set the staff upon the boy's face, but there was no sound or reaction. Therefore he returned to meet him and told him, saying, The boy has not awakened.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>4:32</a></td><td class=td>以利沙进了屋子，看见孩子死了，放在自己的床上。<br>And when Elisha went into the house, there was the dead boy, laid out on his bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>4:33</a></td><td class=td>他就关上门，只有自己和孩子在里面，他便向耶和华祷告。<br>And he went in and shut the door behind the two of them, and he prayed to Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>4:34</a></td><td class=td>又上床伏在孩子身上，口对口，眼对眼，手对手；既俯伏在孩子身上，孩子的身体就渐渐温暖起来。<br>Then he got up and lay on the child, and he put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his palms on his palms; and he stretched himself over him, and the flesh of the child became warm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>4:35</a></td><td class=td>然后他下来，在屋里来往走了一趟，又上去俯伏在孩子身上，孩子打了七个喷嚏，就睁开眼睛了。<br>And he got down and walked about in the house once to and fro. Then he got up and stretched himself over him, and the boy sneezed seven times. Then the boy opened his eyes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>4:36</a></td><td class=td>以利沙叫基哈西说，你叫那书念妇人来；于是基哈西去叫她。她来到以利沙那里，以利沙说，将你儿子抱起来。<br>And he called Gehazi and said, Call that Shunammite. So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, Take up your son.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>4:37</a></td><td class=td>妇人就进来，在以利沙脚前俯伏于地，向他下拜，然后抱起她儿子出去了。<br>And she came and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground. And she took up her son and went out.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>4:38</a></td><td class=td>以利沙又来到吉甲，那地正有饥荒。申言者的门徒坐在他面前，他对仆人说，你将大锅放在火上，给申言者的门徒熬汤。<br>Then Elisha returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. And the sons of the prophets sat before him. And he said to his attendant, Put on the big pot, and boil some stew for the sons of the prophets.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>4:39</a></td><td class=td>有一个人出到田野掐菜，遇见一棵野瓜藤，就摘了一兜野瓜；他进来把瓜切了，搁在熬汤的锅中，他们并不知道那是什么东西。<br>And one went out into the field to gather herbs.
