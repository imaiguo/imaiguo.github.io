Or has he no heir? Why has Malcam possessed Gad, And why do his people dwell in his cities?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>49:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和华说，因此日子将到，我必使人听见打仗的呐喊，是攻击亚扪人拉巴的呐喊。拉巴要成为乱堆；其乡村要被火焚烧；先前赶出以色列的，这时以色列要赶出他们；这是耶和华说的。<br>Therefore indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, When I will cause the alarm of war to be heard Against Rabbah of the children of Ammon. And it will become a mound of desolation, And its villages will be burned with fire. And Israel will dispossess those who dispossess him, Says Jehovah.</td></tr>

Gird yourselves with sackcloth and  wail, And run to and fro among the enclosures; For Malcam will go into exile, Together with his priests and his princes.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>49:24</a></td><td class=td>大马色发软，转身逃跑；恐慌将她捉住，痛苦忧愁将她抓住，如正在生产的妇人一样。<br>Damascus has become feeble; She has turned to flee, And\caps0  panic has taken hold of her; Pain and anguish seize her, Like a woman giving birth.</td></tr>
