<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>23:7</a></td><td class=td>阿荷拉就与他们放纵淫行，他们都是亚述人中最美的男子；她因一切所贪恋之人，因他们的一切偶像，玷污了自己。<br>And she bestowed her fornication upon them, all of them the choice men of Assyria; and with all whom she lusted after, with all their idols, she defiled herself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>23:8</a></td><td class=td>她没有离开从她在埃及的时候就犯的淫乱；因为她年幼作处女的时候，埃及人就与她同寝，抚摸她的乳，纵欲与她行淫。<br>And she did not abandon her fornication from her time in Egypt; for in her youth they had lain with her, and they had handled her virgin bosom, and they had poured out their fornication upon her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>23:9</a></td><td class=td>因此，我将她交在她所爱的人手中，就是她所贪恋的亚述人手中。<br>Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians whom she lusted after.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>23:29</a></td><td class=td>他们必以恨恶对付你，夺取你一切劳碌得来的，撇下你赤身露体；你淫乱的下体，连你的淫行，带你的淫乱，都被显露。<br>And they will deal with you in hatred and will take all that you have gained; and they will abandon you, naked and bare, and the nakedness of your fornication will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your fornication.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>23:30</a></td><td class=td>人必向你行这些事，因为你随从外邦人行邪淫，被他们的偶像玷污了。<br>These things will be done to you because you have gone after the nations as a harlot, because you have defiled yourself with their idols.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>23:35</a></td><td class=td>主耶和华如此说，因你忘记我，将我丢在背后，所以你也要担当你淫行和淫乱的报应。<br>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you have forgotten Me and have cast Me behind your back, bear now as well your lewdness and your fornication.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>23:36</a></td><td class=td>耶和华又对我说，人子阿，你要审问阿荷拉与阿荷利巴么？当向她们说明她们所行可憎的事。<br>And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare their abominations to them.</td></tr>
