<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>9:1</a></td><td class=td>这样，第一约的确有敬拜的章则，和属世界的圣幕。<br>Now then the first covenant also had ordinances of service, and its sanctuary was of this world. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>9:2</a></td><td class=td>因为有预备好的帐幕，头一层叫作圣所，里面有灯台、桌子和陈设饼；<br>For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which were the lampstand and the table and the loaves that were set forth, which is called the Holy Place; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>9:3</a></td><td class=td>第二幔子后，还有一层帐幕，叫作至圣所，<br>And after the second veil, a tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>9:4</a></td><td class=td>有金香坛，和四面包金的约柜，柜里有盛吗哪的金罐、和亚伦发过芽的杖、并两块约版；<br>Having a golden altar and the ark of the covenant covered about everywhere with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna and Aaron's rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>9:5</a></td><td class=td>柜上面有荣耀的基路伯覆荫着平息处；关于这几件，现在不能一一细说。<br>And above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the propitiation place, concerning which it is not now the time to speak in detail. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>9:6</a></td><td class=td>这些物件都这样预备好了，众祭司就常常进入头一层帐幕，完成敬拜；<br>Now these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle the priests enter continually, accomplishing their worship; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>9:7</a></td><td class=td>至于第二层帐幕，只有大祭司一年一次独自进去，没有不带着血，为自己和百姓误犯的罪献上的；<br>But into the second, only the high priest enters, once a year and not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>9:8</a></td><td class=td>圣灵如此指明，当头一层帐幕仍然存立的时候，至圣所的路还未显明；<br>The Holy Spirit thus making this clear, that the way of the Holy of Holies has not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>9:9</a></td><td class=td>那头一层帐幕作现今时期的一个象征，按这象征所献的礼物和祭物，就着良心说，都不能叫敬拜的人得以完全；<br>Which is a figure for the present time. According to this tabernacle both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are unable to perfect, according to conscience, him who worships, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>9:10</a></td><td class=td>这些不过是在于饮食和各样的浸洗，都是属肉体的章则，制定到更正的时期。<br>Consisting only of foods and drinks and various washings, being ordinances of the flesh, imposed until the time of setting things right. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>9:11</a></td><td class=td>但基督已经来到，作了那已经实现之美事的大祭司，经过那更大、更全备的帐幕，不是人手所造的，就是不属这受造世界的；<br>But Christ, having come as a High Priest of the good things that have come into being, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands, that is, not of this creation, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>9:12</a></td><td class=td>并且不是借着山羊和牛犊的血，乃是借着祂自己的血，一次永远的进入至圣所，便得到了永远的救赎。<br>And not through the blood of goats and calves but through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>9:13</a></td><td class=td>若山羊和公牛的血，并母牛犊的灰，洒在污秽的人身上，尚且使人圣别，以致人的肉身得着洁净，<br>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are defiled sanctify to the purity of the flesh, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>9:14</a></td><td class=td>何况基督借着永远的灵，将自己无瑕无疵的献给神，祂的血岂不更洁净我们的良心，使其脱离死行，叫我们事奉活神么？<br>How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>9:15</a></td><td class=td>所以，祂作了新约的中保，既然受死，赎了人在第一约之下的过犯，便叫蒙召之人得着所应许永远的产业。<br>And because of this He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>9:16</a></td><td class=td>凡有遗命，立遗命者的死必须证实出来；<br>For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>9:17</a></td><td class=td>因为留遗命的人死了，遗命才得确定；立遗命的人还活着的时候，遗命是没有效力的。<br>For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>9:18</a></td><td class=td>所以第一约也不是不用血创立的。<br>Hence neither was the first covenant initiated without blood; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>9:19</a></td><td class=td>因为各条诫命既由摩西照着律法，向众百姓讲过了，他就拿牛犊和山羊的血，用水和朱红色绒并牛膝草，洒在那约书上，并众百姓身上，说，<br>For when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll of the covenant itself and all the people, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>9:20</a></td><td class=td>“这就是神与你们所立之约的血。”<br>Saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded to you.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>9:21</a></td><td class=td>他又照样把血洒在帐幕和一切敬拜用的器皿上。<br>And both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service he sprinkled in like manner with the blood. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>9:22</a></td><td class=td>按着律法，凡物差不多都是用血洁净的，没有流血，就没有赦罪。<br>And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>9:23</a></td><td class=td>所以，诸天上之物的样本，必须用这些祭物去洁净；但那天上之物的本身，必须用比这些更美的祭物去洁净。<br>It was necessary therefore for the examples of the things in the heavens to be purified by these, but the heavenly things themselves, by better sacrifices than these. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>9:24</a></td><td class=td>因为基督并不是进入人手所造的圣所，那不过是真圣所的复本，乃是进入了天的本身，如今为我们显在神面前；<br>For Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands, a figure of the true, but into heaven itself, to appear now before the face of God for us; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>9:25</a></td><td class=td>祂也不是多次将自己献上，像那大祭司每年带着牛羊的血进入至圣所；<br>Nor in order that He might offer Himself often, just as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies year by year by the blood of other creatures; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>9:26</a></td><td class=td>如果这样，从创世以来，祂就必须多次受苦了；但如今祂在诸世代的终结显明了一次，好借着献上自己为祭，把罪除掉。<br>Since then He would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>9:27</a></td><td class=td>按着定命，人人都有一死，死后且有审判；<br>And inasmuch as it is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>9:28</a></td><td class=td>基督也是这样，既一次被献，担当了多人的罪，将来还要向那热切等待祂的人第二次显现，并与罪无关，乃为拯救他们。<br>So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
