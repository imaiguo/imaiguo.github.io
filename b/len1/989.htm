<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>16:1</a></td><td class=td>耶稣又对门徒说，有一个财主，他有一个管家，有人向他控告这人挥霍主人的财物。<br>And He said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this one was accused to him of squandering his possessions. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>16:2</a></td><td class=td>主人叫管家来，对他说，我所听到关于你的事，是怎么样？把你管家职分的账目交代清楚，因你不能再作管家了。<br>And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear concerning you? Render the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>16:3</a></td><td class=td>那管家心里说，主人要撤去我的管家职分，我该作什么才好？锄地吧，无力；讨饭吧，怕羞。<br>And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>16:4</a></td><td class=td>我知道该怎么作，好叫人在我被撤去管家职分之后，可以接我到他们家里去。<br>I know what I will do so that when I am removed from the stewardship they may receive me into their own houses. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>16:5</a></td><td class=td>于是把欠他主人债的，一个一个的叫了来，问头一个说，你欠我主人多少？<br>And when he had called to him each one of his master's debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe my master? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>16:6</a></td><td class=td>他说，一百篓油。管家说，拿你的账，快坐下写五十。<br>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>16:7</a></td><td class=td>又问另一个说，你欠多少？他说，一百石麦子。管家说，拿你的账写八十。<br>Then to another he said, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill and write eighty. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>16:8</a></td><td class=td>主人就夸奖这不义的管家作事精明；因为今世之子对待自己的世代，比光明之子更加精明。<br>And the master praised the unrighteous steward because he had acted prudently; for the sons of this age are more prudent in their dealings with their own generation than the sons of light. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>16:9</a></td><td class=td>我又告诉你们，要借着那不义的钱财，为自己结交朋友，到了钱财无用的时候，他们可以接你们到永远的帐幕里去。<br>And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>16:12</a></td><td class=td>你们若是在别人的东西上不忠信，谁还把你们自己的东西给你们？<br>And if you have not become faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give to you that which is your own? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>16:13</a></td><td class=td>没有一个家仆能事奉两个主；因为他不是恨这个爱那个，就是忠于这个轻视那个。你们不能事奉神，又事奉玛门。<br>No household servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>16:14</a></td><td class=td>法利赛人是贪爱钱财的，他们听见这一切话，就嗤笑耶稣。<br>And the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things and were sneering at Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>16:15</a></td><td class=td>耶稣对他们说，你们是在人面前自称为义的，但神知道你们的心；因为在人中间高贵的，在神面前却是可憎的。<br>And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>16:17</a></td><td class=td>天地过去，比律法的一画落空还容易。<br>But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one serif of the law to fail. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>16:18</a></td><td class=td>凡休妻另娶的，就是犯奸淫；娶被丈夫所休之妇人的，也是犯奸淫。<br>Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>16:19</a></td><td class=td>有一个财主，素常穿着紫色袍和细麻布衣服，天天奢华宴乐。<br>Now there was a certain rich man, and he clothed himself in purple and fine linen, making merry every day in splendor. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>16:20</a></td><td class=td>又有一个讨饭的，名叫拉撒路，浑身生疮，被人丢在财主门口，<br>And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>16:23</a></td><td class=td>他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远的望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里，<br>And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus in his bosom. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>16:24</a></td><td class=td>就喊着说，我祖亚伯拉罕，可怜我吧，打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头，因为我在这火焰里极其痛苦。<br>And he called out and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this flame. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>16:25</a></td><td class=td>亚伯拉罕说，孩子，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也同样受过苦；如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。<br>But Abraham said, Child, remember that in your lifetime you fully received your good things, and Lazarus likewise bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>16:26</a></td><td class=td>不但这样，在我们与你们之间还有深渊隔定，以致人想要从这边过到你们那边是不能的，从那边越过来到我们这边也是不能的。<br>And besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may any cross over. </td></tr>
