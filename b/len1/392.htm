<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>25:4</a></td><td class=td>但他没有将他们的儿子处死，是照摩西书上律法所写，耶和华所吩咐的，说，父亲不可因儿子的缘故被处死，儿子也不可因父亲的缘故被处死；各人要因自己的罪被处死。<br>But their children he did not put to death, but acted according to what is written in the law in the book of Moses, where Jehovah commanded, saying, Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children, nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>25:15</a></td><td class=td>耶和华的怒气向亚玛谢发作，就差一个申言者去见他，说，这民的神不能救自己的民脱离你的手，你为何寻求它们呢？<br>And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah; and He sent a prophet to him and said to him, Why do you seek after the gods of the people who did not deliver their own people from your hand?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>25:16</a></td><td class=td>申言者与王说话的时候，王对他说，我们何曾立你作王的谋士呢？你住口罢；为何要挨打呢？申言者就止住了；又说，我知道神定意要灭你，因为你行这事，不听从我出的主意。<br>And when he spoke to him, the  king said to him, Have we made you a counselor to the king? Stop; why should you be struck down? So the prophet stopped and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, for you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.</td></tr>

Remain now in your home; why should you stir up trouble so that you and Judah with you fall?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>25:20</a></td><td class=td>亚玛谢却不肯听；这是出于神，好将他们交在敌人手里，因为他们寻求以东的神。<br>But Amaziah would not listen, for it was of God, so that He might deliver them into his hand, for they had sought after the gods of Edom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>25:21</a></td><td class=td>于是以色列王约阿施上来，在属犹大的伯示麦，与犹大王亚玛谢在战场上彼此见面。<br>So Jehoash the king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah the king of Judah  confronted each other in Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</td></tr>
