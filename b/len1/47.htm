<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>47:4</a></td><td class=td>他们又对法老说，迦南地的饥荒甚重，那里没有草场供应你仆人们的羊群，所以我们来到这地寄居。现在求你让仆人们住在歌珊地。<br>And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land because there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>47:14</a></td><td class=td>约瑟收聚了埃及地和迦南地所有的银子，就是众人买粮的银子；约瑟就把那银子带到法老的宫里。<br>And Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>47:15</a></td><td class=td>埃及地和迦南地的银子都花尽了，埃及众人都来见约瑟，说，我们的银子都用尽了，求你给我们粮食，我们为什么要死在你面前呢？<br>And when the money from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan had been spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph saying, Give us food, for why should we die in your presence?

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>47:16</a></td><td class=td>约瑟说，若是银子用尽了，可以把你们的牲畜带来，我就给你们粮食，来换你们的牲畜。<br>And Joseph said, Bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>47:17</a></td><td class=td>于是他们把牲畜赶到约瑟那里，约瑟就拿粮食换了他们的马、羊群、牛群和驴；那一年因换他们一切的牲畜，就用粮食养活他们。<br>And they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and for the flocks of sheep and for the herds of cattle and for the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>47:18</a></td><td class=td>那一年过去，第二年他们又来见约瑟，说，我们不瞒我主，我们的银子都花尽了，牲畜也都归了我主。我们在我主眼前，除了我们的身体和田地之外，一无所剩。<br>And when that year had ended, they came to him the second year and said to him, We cannot hide from my lord that our money has been spent, and the herds of cattle are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord except our bodies and our lands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>47:19</a></td><td class=td>我们为什么要在你面前人死地荒呢？求你用粮食买我们和我们的地，我们和我们的地就要给法老效力；并且求你给我们种子，使我们得以存活，不至死亡，地土也不至荒凉。<br>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will become servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>47:20</a></td><td class=td>于是约瑟为法老买了埃及所有的地；埃及人因被饥荒所迫，各都卖了自己的田地；那地就都归了法老。<br>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>47:22</a></td><td class=td>惟有祭司的地，约瑟没有买，因为祭司有从法老所得的常奉。他们吃法老所给的常奉，所以他们不卖自己的地。<br>Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh, and they lived off their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>47:23</a></td><td class=td>那时约瑟对百姓说，看哪，我今日为法老买了你们和你们的地；这里有种子给你们，你们可以种地。<br>Then Joseph said to the people, Now that I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you that you may sow the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>47:24</a></td><td class=td>到收割的时候，你们要把五分之一纳给法老，五分之四可以归你们自己作田地里的种子，也作你们、你们家人和孩童的食物。<br>And when harvest comes, you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own as seed of the field and as food for you and for those of your households and as food for your little ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>47:25</a></td><td class=td>他们说，你救了我们的性命。但愿我们在我主眼前蒙恩，我们就作法老的仆人。<br>And they said, You have saved our lives. May we find favor in the sight of my lord and be Pharaoh's servants.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>47:26</a></td><td class=td>于是约瑟为埃及的地立下定例，直到今日：法老必得五分之一，惟独祭司的地不归法老。<br>And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt that stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>47:27</a></td><td class=td>以色列人住在埃及的歌珊地；他们在那里置了产业，并且极其繁衍增多。<br>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they acquired possessions in it and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>47:29</a></td><td class=td>以色列的死期临近了，他就叫了他儿子约瑟来，说，我若在你眼前蒙恩，请你把手放在我大腿下起誓；用恩慈和诚信待我，请你不要将我葬在埃及。<br>And the time for Israel to die drew near. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and truth; please do not bury me in Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>47:30</a></td><td class=td>我与我祖我父同睡的时候，你要将我带出埃及，葬在他们所葬的地方。约瑟说，我必遵着你的话而行。<br>But when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>47:31</a></td><td class=td>雅各说，你要向我起誓。约瑟就向他起了誓，于是以色列在床头上敬拜神。<br>And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself at the head of his bed.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
