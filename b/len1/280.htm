<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>13:1</a></td><td class=td>此后发生了一件事：大卫的儿子押沙龙有一个美丽的妹妹，名叫他玛；大卫的儿子暗嫩爱上了她。<br>And some time after this, it so happened that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>13:2</a></td><td class=td>暗嫩为他妹妹他玛忧急成病；因为他玛还是处女，暗嫩眼看难以向她行事。<br>And Amnon was so distraught that he made himself sick because of Tamar his sister; for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>13:3</a></td><td class=td>暗嫩有一个朋友，名叫约拿达，是大卫哥哥示米亚的儿子。这约拿达为人极其狡猾；<br>Now Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very crafty man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>13:4</a></td><td class=td>他问暗嫩说，王的儿子阿，你为何一天比一天瘦弱呢？你不能告诉我么？暗嫩对他说，我爱上了我兄弟押沙龙的妹妹他玛。<br>And he said to him, Why are you, O son of the king, so downcast morning after morning? Will you not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>13:5</a></td><td class=td>约拿达说，你躺在床上装病；你父亲来看你，就对他说，请叫我妹妹他玛来，把食物递给我吃；叫她在我眼前豫备食物，使我看见，好从她手里接过来吃。<br>And Jonadab said to him, Lie down on your bed, and pretend to be sick; and when your father comes to see you, tell him, Please let Tamar my sister come and give me bread to eat, and let her make  me food in my sight that I may see it and eat from her hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>13:6</a></td><td class=td>于是暗嫩躺卧装病。王来看他，他对王说，请叫我妹妹他玛来，在我眼前作两个饼，我好从她手里接过来吃。<br>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat  them from her hand.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>13:7</a></td><td class=td>大卫就打发人到宫里，对他玛说，你往你哥哥暗嫩的屋里去，为他豫备食物。<br>Then David sent  word home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and make him food.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>13:8</a></td><td class=td>他玛就到她哥哥暗嫩的屋里；暗嫩正躺卧。他玛把面拿来抟好，在他眼前作饼，且烤熟了。<br>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded  it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>13:9</a></td><td class=td>她把锅拿来，在他面前将饼从锅里倒出来，他却不肯吃，说，叫众人离开我出去罢！众人就都离开他，出去了。<br>And she took the pan and emptied  it before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, Have all the men go out from me. And all the men went out from him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>13:10</a></td><td class=td>暗嫩对他玛说，你把食物拿进内室，我好从你手里接过来吃。他玛就把所作的饼拿来，送到内室她哥哥暗嫩那里，<br>And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into  my room so that I may eat from your hand. And Tamar took the cakes that she had made and brought  them to Amnon her brother in  his room.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>13:11</a></td><td class=td>拿着饼上前给他吃，他便拉住他玛，说，我妹妹，你来与我同寝。<br>And when she brought  them near to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, Come lie with me, my sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>13:12</a></td><td class=td>他玛说，我哥哥，不可这样，不要玷辱我。以色列中不当这样行，你不要作这愚妄的事。<br>And she said to him, No, my brother. Do not force me, for such a thing should not be done in Israel. Do not commit this folly.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>13:13</a></td><td class=td>你玷辱了我，我要将我的羞耻带往那里去呢？至于你，你在以色列中也必成了愚妄人。现在请你向王题说，他必不禁止我归你。<br>And where will I carry my shame? And you, you will be like one of the foolish men in Israel. Now therefore, speak to the king, I beg you; for he will not withhold me from you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>13:14</a></td><td class=td>但暗嫩不肯听她的话，因比她力大，就玷辱她，与她同寝。<br>But he would not listen to her voice. And being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>13:15</a></td><td class=td>随后，暗嫩极其恨她，那恨她的恨比先前爱她的爱更甚。暗嫩对她说，你起来，去罢。<br>Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Rise up  and go.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>13:16</a></td><td class=td>他玛对他说，不要这样，你赶我出去，这恶比你先前对我所行的更大。但暗嫩不肯听她的话，<br>But she said to him, Do not cause this greater wrong by sending me away,  greater than the other that you have done to me. But he would not listen to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>13:17</a></td><td class=td>就叫伺候自己的僮仆来，说，将这个女子从我这里赶出去，随后就关门上闩。<br>And he called his young man who served him and said, Send this woman away from me outside, and bolt the door behind her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>13:18</a></td><td class=td>那时他玛穿着长袖衣服，因为没有出嫁的公主都是穿这样的外袍。暗嫩的仆人就把她领出去，随后关门上闩。<br>Now she had a long garment with sleeves, for the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in such robes. So his servant brought her outside and bolted the door behind her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>13:19</a></td><td class=td>他玛把灰撒在头上，撕裂所穿的长袖衣服，以手抱头，一面行走，一面哭喊。<br>And Tamar put ashes upon her head and rent the long garment with sleeves that was upon her, and she put her hand on her head and went off, crying aloud as she went.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>13:20</a></td><td class=td>她胞兄押沙龙问她说，莫非你哥哥暗嫩与你亲近了么？我妹妹，暂且不要作声，他是你的哥哥，不要将这事放在心上。他玛就孤孤单单的住在她胞兄押沙龙家里。<br>Then Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? But be quiet now, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this thing to heart. And Tamar remained in her brother Absalom's house, desolate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>13:21</a></td><td class=td>大卫王听见这一切事，就甚发怒。<br>And when King David heard about all these things, he was very angry.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>13:22</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙并不和他哥哥暗嫩说好说歹；因为暗嫩玷辱他妹妹他玛，所以押沙龙恨恶他。<br>But Absalom did not speak anything good or evil to Amnon, for Absalom hated Amnon because he had forced Tamar his sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>13:23</a></td><td class=td>过了二年，在靠近以法莲的巴力夏琐，有人为押沙龙剪羊毛；押沙龙请王的众子与他同去。<br>Then after two full years, while Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal-hazor, which is by Ephraim, Absalom invited all the king's sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>13:24</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙来见王，说，现在有人为仆人剪羊毛，请王和王的臣仆与仆人同去。<br>And Absalom came to the king and said, Your servant now has sheep shearers. May the king and his servants go now with your servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>13:25</a></td><td class=td>王对押沙龙说，不必，我儿，我们不必都去，免得你负担太重。押沙龙恳切请王，王仍是不肯去，只是为他祝福。<br>But the king said to Absalom, No, my son; let us not all go, or we will be a burden to you. And he pressed him, but he would not go; yet he gave him his blessing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>13:26</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙说，王若不去，请让我哥哥暗嫩与我们同去。王说，何必要他与你同去呢？<br>Then Absalom said, If not, then let Amnon my brother go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>13:27</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙恳切求王，王就派暗嫩和王的众子与他同去。<br>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>13:28</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙吩咐仆人说，你们注意，看暗嫩饮酒，心里高兴的时候，我对你们说，杀暗嫩，你们便杀他，不要惧怕。这不是我吩咐你们的么？你们只管刚强奋勇。<br>And Absalom commanded his attendants, saying, Watch now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say to you, Strike Amnon, then kill him. Do not be afraid; is it not I who have commanded you? Be strong and valiant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>13:29</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙的仆人就照押沙龙所吩咐的，向暗嫩行了。王的众子都起来，各人骑上骡子，逃跑了。<br>And Absalom's attendants did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. And all the king's sons rose up, and each mounted his mule and fled.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>13:30</a></td><td class=td>他们还在路上，有风声传到大卫那里，说，押沙龙将王的众子都击杀了，没有留下一个。<br>And while they were on the way, the report came to David, namely, Absalom has struck down all the king's sons, and not one of them is left.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>13:31</a></td><td class=td>王就起来，撕裂自己的衣服，躺在地上；王的臣仆也都撕裂衣服，站在旁边。<br>And the king rose up and rent his garments and lay on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their garments rent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>13:32</a></td><td class=td>大卫哥哥示米亚的儿子约拿达回应说，我主，不要以为他们把王的众子少年人都杀了，其实只有暗嫩一个人死了。自从暗嫩玷辱押沙龙妹妹他玛的那日，押沙龙就定意杀暗嫩了。<br>Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord think that all the young men, the sons of the king, have been killed, for Amnon alone is dead. For this has been determined by Absalom since the day Amnon forced Tamar his sister.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>13:33</a></td><td class=td>现在，我主我王，不要把这事放在心上，以为王的众子都死了；其实只有暗嫩一个人死了。<br>Now therefore let my lord the king not take the matter to heart, thinking that all the king's sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>13:34</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙逃跑了。守望的少年人举目观看，见有许多人从后面山边的路而来。<br>But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and there  they were, a multitude of people coming from the road behind him at the side of the mountain.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>13:35</a></td><td class=td>约拿达对王说，看哪，王的众子都来了，果然与你仆人所说的相合。<br>Then Jonadab said to the king, Here come the king's sons; as your servant has said, so has it been.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>13:36</a></td><td class=td>话才说完，王的众子都到了，放声大哭。王和众臣仆也都哭得甚恸。<br>And when he had finished speaking, there came the king's sons, and they lifted up their voice and wept. And the king and all his servants also wept exceedingly.</td></tr>
