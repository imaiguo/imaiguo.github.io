<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>耶和华阿，你的眼目不是看顾忠信么？你击打他们，他们却不伤恸；你毁灭他们，他们却不受管教。他们使脸刚硬过于磐石，不肯回头。<br>O Jehovah, are not Your eyes upon faithfulness? You have stricken them, But they did not writhe; You have consumed them, But they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder  than rock; They have refused to turn.</td></tr>

A leopard is watching their cities; Everyone who goes out from them will be torn in pieces; Because they multiplied their transgressions, And their apostasies are great in number.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>我怎能赦免你呢？你的儿女离弃了我，又指着那不是神的起誓。我使他们饱足，他们就行奸淫，成群的到娼妓家里。<br>Why should I pardon you? Your children have forsaken Me And sworn by those who are not gods. When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery And trooped to the house of harlots.</td></tr>
