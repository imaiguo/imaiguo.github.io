<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>6:4</a></td><td class=td>那时总长和总督，在国事上寻找但以理的把柄，为要告他，只是找不着他的把柄和过失；因他忠信可靠，在他身上找不到任何疏忽和过失。<br>Then the chief ministers and satraps sought to find a ground for accusation against Daniel from the perspective of the kingdom, but they could find no ground for accusation or fault, inasmuch as he was faithful, and no negligence or fault was found related to him.</td></tr>
