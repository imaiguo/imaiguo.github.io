But they said, No; we will spend the night in the square.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>19:3</a></td><td class=td>罗得切切的请他们，他们才转身进到他屋里。罗得为他们豫备筵席，烤无酵饼，他们就吃了。<br>But he urged them strongly, and they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>19:22</a></td><td class=td>你要快快逃到那里；因为你还没有到那里，我不能作什么。因此那城名叫琐珥。<br>Hurry, escape there; for I cannot do anything until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</td></tr>
