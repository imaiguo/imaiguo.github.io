<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>你们不要再说高傲的话，也不要口出狂妄的言语；因耶和华是全知的神，人的行为被祂衡量。<br>Talk no more so very proudly; Do not let arrogance go forth from your mouth; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, And actions are weighed by Him.</td></tr>

She who was barren has borne seven, And she who had many children languishes.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>2:22</a></td><td class=td>以利年甚老迈，听见他两个儿子待以色列众人的事，又听见他们与会幕门前服事的妇人苟合；<br>Now Eli was very old, and he heard of all that his sons did to all Israel and how they lay with the women who were engaged in service at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>他就对他们说，你们为何行这样的事？我从这众百姓听见你们所行的恶事。<br>And he said to them, Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>2:24</a></td><td class=td>我儿阿，不可这样；我听见耶和华百姓所传的风声不好。<br>No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear Jehovah's people spreading.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>2:25</a></td><td class=td>人若得罪人，有神为他作仲裁；人若得罪耶和华，有谁能为他作仲裁呢？然而他们还是不听父亲的话，因为耶和华想要杀他们。<br>If one man sins against another man, God will arbitrate for him; but if a man sins against Jehovah, who will arbitrate for him? But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was pleased to kill them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>2:26</a></td><td class=td>童子撒母耳在身量上，并在耶和华与人对他的喜爱上，都不断增长。<br>And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor both with Jehovah and with men.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>2:27</a></td><td class=td>有神人来见以利，对他说，耶和华如此说，你父家在埃及法老家作奴仆的时候，我不是明明向他们显现么？<br>And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, I revealed Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt as slaves to Pharaoh's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>2:28</a></td><td class=td>在以色列众支派中，我不是拣选他们作我的祭司，使他们上我的坛，又向我烧香，并且在我面前穿着以弗得么？我不是将以色列人所献的火祭都赐给你父家么？<br>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up to My altar, to burn incense,  and to wear the ephod before Me. And I gave the house of your father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>2:29</a></td><td class=td>我所吩咐献在我居所的祭物和供物，你们为何践踏呢？你为何尊重你的儿子过于尊重我，将我民以色列所献一切供物中上好的部分肥己呢？<br>Why then do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering, which I have commanded in  My habitation, and honor your sons more than Me by making yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>2:30</a></td><td class=td>因此，耶和华以色列的神宣示说，我确实说过，你家和你父家必永远行在我面前；但现在我耶和华宣示说，我绝不容你们这样行。因为尊重我的，我必尊重他们；藐视我的，他们必被轻视。<br>Therefore Jehovah the God of Israel declares, I surely said that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever; but now Jehovah declares, Far be it from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who spurn Me will be lightly esteemed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>2:31</a></td><td class=td>日子要到，我必折断你的膀臂和你父家的膀臂，使你家中没有一个老年人。<br>The days are now coming when I will cut off your arm and the arm of the house of your father, so that there will not be an old man in your house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>2:32</a></td><td class=td>在我使以色列人享各样好处的时候，你必看见我居所的败落；在你家中必永远没有一个老年人。<br>And you shall see the distress of  My habitation in the midst of all the good that I will do to Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>2:33</a></td><td class=td>你家中未从我坛前被我剪除的人，必使你眼目失明，魂中忧伤。你家中所增加的人口都必死在人的刀下。<br>And  that man of yours whom I do not cut off from My altar  shall be  left to consume your eyes and to grieve your soul, and all the increase of your house shall die by the swords of men.</td></tr>
