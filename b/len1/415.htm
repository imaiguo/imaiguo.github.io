<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>亚达薛西王二十年尼散月，有酒摆在王面前，我拿起酒来奉给王。我素来在他面前没有愁容。<br>Then in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, while wine was being set before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>王对我说，你既没有病，为什么面带愁容呢？这不是别的，必是你心中愁烦。于是我甚惧怕。<br>And the king said to me, Why is your face sad, since you are not ill? This is nothing other than sadness of heart. Then I was greatly frightened.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>我对王说，愿王万岁！我列祖坟墓所在的那城荒凉，城门被火焚烧，我岂能面无愁容呢？<br>And I said to the king, May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' graves, lies in waste and its gates are consumed with fire?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>王问我说，你要求什么？于是我祷告天上的神。<br>And the king said to me, What do you request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>我对王说，王若以为美，仆人若在王面前蒙恩惠，求王差遣我往犹大，到我列祖坟墓所在的城去，我好重新建造那城。<br>And I said to the king, If it please the king and if your servant has found favor before you, that you would send me to Judah to the city of my fathers' graves that I may rebuild it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>那时王后坐在王的旁边。王问我说，你去需时多久？几时回来？王喜欢差遣我去，我也把日期告诉了王。<br>And the king said to me (and the queen was sitting beside him), How long will your going be, and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a date.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>我又对王说，王若以为美，请赐我诏书，通知大河以西的诸省长准我经过，直到我抵达犹大；<br>Then I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given to me for the governors beyond the River, so that they will let me pass through until I come to Judah;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>又赐诏书，通知看守王园林的亚萨，使他给我木料，作属殿营楼之门的横梁，并供城墙和我要住的房屋使用。因我神美善的手帮助我，王就把我所求的赐给我。<br>And a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the Park, which belongs to the king, so that he would give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace that belongs to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I will be entering. And the king gave these to me according to the good hand of my God, which was upon me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>王派了军长和马兵护送我。我到了河西的诸省长那里，将王的诏书交给他们。<br>So I went to the governors beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>和伦人参巴拉，并作臣仆的亚扪人多比雅，听见有人来为以色列人求好处，就甚恼怒。<br>And when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard of this, it displeased them greatly that a man had come seeking the good of the children of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>我到了耶路撒冷，在那里住了三日。<br>Thus I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>我夜间起来，有几个人也一同起来；但神使我心里起意要为耶路撒冷作什么事，我并没有告诉人。除了我骑的牲口以外，也没有别的牲口在我那里。<br>And I arose at night, I and some few men with me. And I told no man what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. And there was no animal with me except the animal I rode on.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>当夜我出了谷门，往野狗泉去，到了粪门，察看耶路撒冷的城墙，见城墙被拆毁，城门被火焚烧。<br>And I went out at night by the Valley Gate, toward the Jackals' Spring and the Dung Gate, and inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down and whose gates had been consumed with fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>我又往前，到了泉门和王池，但所骑的牲口没有地方过去。<br>Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool, but there was no place for the animal under me to pass through.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>于是我在夜间沿溪而上，察看城墙，又转身进入谷门，就回来了。<br>And I went up at night by the brook and inspected the wall, and turned back and went in by the Valley Gate and so returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>我去过那里，作了什么事，官长都不知道；我还没有告诉犹大人、祭司、贵胄、官长、和其余作工的人。<br>And the rulers did not know where I had gone or what I had been doing; and I had not as yet told it to the Jews and the priests and the nobles and the rulers and the rest who were to do the work.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>以后，我对他们说，我们所遭的祸患，耶路撒冷怎样荒凉，城门被火焚烧，你们都看见了。来罢，我们重建耶路撒冷的城墙，免得再受凌辱。<br>Then I said to them, You see the bad state we are in, that Jerusalem lies in waste and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>我告诉他们，我神美善的手怎样帮助我，也把王对我所说的话告诉他们。他们就说，我们起来建造罢；于是他们奋勇作这善工。<br>And I told them about the hand of my God, which was good upon me, and also about the king's words, which he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up and build; and they strengthened their hands for the good work.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>但和伦人参巴拉、作臣仆的亚扪人多比雅、和亚拉伯人基善听见，就嗤笑我们，藐视我们，说，你们作的是什么事？你们要背叛王么？<br>But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and Geshem the Arabian heard of it, they mocked us and despised us; and they said, What is this thing that you will do? Will you rebel against the king?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>我回答他们说，天上的神必亲自使我们亨通；所以我们作祂仆人的，要起来建造。你们却在耶路撒冷无分、无权、无记念。<br>And I answered them and said to them, The God of heaven Himself will make us prosper; therefore we His servants will rise up and build. But you have no portion nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
