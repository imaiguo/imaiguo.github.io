<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>6:6</a></td><td class=td>神人问说，掉在那里了？他将那地方指给以利沙看。以利沙砍了一根木头，抛在那里，就使斧头浮上来。<br>And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick and threw it there and made the iron float.</td></tr>

And his attendant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>6:16</a></td><td class=td>神人说，不要惧怕，因为与我们同在的，比与他们同在的更多。<br>And he said, Do not fear, for they who are with us are more than they who are with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>6:17</a></td><td class=td>以利沙祷告说，耶和华阿，求你开他的眼目，使他能看见。耶和华开少年人的眼目，他就看见满山有火车火马围绕以利沙。<br>And Elisha prayed and said, O Jehovah, open his eyes that he may see.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>6:18</a></td><td class=td>亚兰人下到以利沙那里，以利沙祷告耶和华说，求你击打这民，使他们眼目昏迷。耶和华就照以利沙的话，击打他们，使他们眼目昏迷。<br>And when the  Syrians came down to him, Elisha prayed to Jehovah and said, Strike this nation with blindness.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>6:19</a></td><td class=td>以利沙对他们说，这不是那条路，也不是那座城；你们跟我去，我必领你们到所寻找的人那里。于是领他们到了撒玛利亚。<br>Then Elisha said to them, This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. And he brought them to Samaria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>6:20</a></td><td class=td>他们进了撒玛利亚，以利沙祷告说，耶和华阿，求你开这些人的眼目，使他们能看见。耶和华开他们的眼目，他们就看见了，不料，是在撒玛利亚的城中。<br>And when they came to Samaria, Elisha said, O Jehovah, open the eyes of these men that they may see.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>6:23</a></td><td class=td>王就为他们豫备了盛大的筵席；他们吃喝完了，王打发他们离去，他们就回到自己主人那里。从此，亚兰人不再结队侵犯以色列地了。<br>Then he prepared a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria no longer came into the land of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>6:24</a></td><td class=td>此后，亚兰王便哈达聚集他的全军，上来围困撒玛利亚。<br>And after this Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>6:25</a></td><td class=td>于是撒玛利亚有了大饥荒；城被围困，以致一个驴头卖八十舍客勒银子，半升鸽子粪卖五舍客勒银子。<br>And there was a great famine in Samaria; and they besieged it until the head of a donkey was sold for eighty pieces of silver and a fourth part of a kab of doves' dung was sold for five pieces of silver.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>6:27</a></td><td class=td>王说，耶和华不帮助你，我从何处帮助你？是从禾场，或是从酒醡呢？<br>And he said, If Jehovah does not help you, from where shall I help you? From the threshing floor or the winepress?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>6:28</a></td><td class=td>王问妇人说，你有什么事？她说，这妇人对我说，将你的儿子交出来，我们今日可以吃，明日可以吃我的儿子。<br>And the king said to her, What is your trouble? And she said, This woman said to me, Give up your son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>6:29</a></td><td class=td>我们就煮了我的儿子吃了。次日我对她说，将你的儿子交出来，我们可以吃；她却将她的儿子藏起来了。<br>So we boiled my son and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, Give up your son that we may eat him; but she hid her son.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>6:30</a></td><td class=td>王听见妇人的话，就撕裂衣服；当时王在城上经过，百姓看见王贴身穿着麻衣。<br>And when the king heard the woman's words, he tore his clothes. And as he passed by upon the wall, the people could see that he had sackcloth upon his flesh underneath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>6:31</a></td><td class=td>王说，我今日若让沙法的儿子以利沙的头仍留在他身上，愿神重重的降罚与我。<br>And he said, God do so to me, and even more, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>6:32</a></td><td class=td>那时，以利沙正坐在家中，长老们也与他同坐。王从他面前伺候的人中打发一个人去；使者还没有到，以利沙就对长老们说，你们有没有看见这凶手之子，打发人来取我的头？你们看着使者来到，就关上门，用门将他推出去。在他后头不是有他主人脚步的响声么？<br>Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king had sent a man from before him. Before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do you see that this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? When the messenger comes, see that you shut the door and  hold the door closed against him. Surely the sound of his master's feet is behind him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>6:33</a></td><td class=td>以利沙还与他们说话的时候，使者下到他那里，王也到了，说，这灾祸是从耶和华那里来的，我何必再仰望耶和华呢？<br>While he was still talking with them, the  king came down to him and said, This evil is from Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
