<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>23:1</a></td><td class=td>保罗定睛看着议会，说，诸位，弟兄们，我在神面前行事为人都是凭着无亏的良心，直到今日。<br>And Paul, looking intently at the Sanhedrin, said, Men, brothers, I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>23:2</a></td><td class=td>大祭司亚拿尼亚就吩咐旁边站着的人打他的嘴。<br>And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>23:3</a></td><td class=td>保罗对他说，你这粉饰的墙，神将要击打你了。你坐堂是要按律法审问我，你竟违背律法，吩咐人打我么？<br>Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall. And do you sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law you order me to be struck? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>23:4</a></td><td class=td>站在旁边的人说，你辱骂神的大祭司么？<br>And those standing by said, Do you revile the high priest of God? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>23:5</a></td><td class=td>保罗说，弟兄们，我不晓得他是大祭司；经上记着，“不可毁谤你百姓的官长。”<br>And Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, "You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>23:6</a></td><td class=td>保罗看出其中一部分是撒都该人，另一部分是法利赛人，就在议会中喊着说，诸位，弟兄们，我是法利赛人，是法利赛人的子孙；我现在受审问，是为了盼望死人复活。<br>And Paul, knowing that one part was Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the Sanhedrin, Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged! </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>23:7</a></td><td class=td>他说了这话，法利赛人和撒都该人便起了争执，会众就分裂了。<br>And when he spoke this, a dissension took place between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the multitude was divided. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>23:8</a></td><td class=td>因为撒都该人说没有复活，也没有天使和灵；法利赛人却样样都承认。<br>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>23:9</a></td><td class=td>于是大大的喧嚷起来，有几个法利赛派的经学家站起来争辩说，我们在这人身上看不出什么恶来，说不定有灵或天使对他说过话。<br>And there was a great outcry; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party rose up and contended, saying, We find nothing evil in this man. And what if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>23:10</a></td><td class=td>那时大起纷争，千夫长恐怕保罗被他们扯碎了，就吩咐兵丁下去，把他从众人当中抢出来，带进营楼去。<br>And when much dissension had taken place, the commander, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the detachment of soldiers to go down and seize him from their midst and bring him into the barracks. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>23:11</a></td><td class=td>当夜，主站在保罗旁边说，你当壮胆，你怎样在耶路撒冷郑重的为我作了见证，也必照样在罗马为我作见证。<br>But in the night following, the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have solemnly testified to the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>23:12</a></td><td class=td>到了天亮，犹太人就团结同谋，发咒起誓说，若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝。<br>And when it became day, the Jews formed a plot and put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>23:13</a></td><td class=td>一同起誓订这阴谋的，有四十多人。<br>And there were more than forty who swore to this conspiracy. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>23:14</a></td><td class=td>他们来到祭司长和长老跟前，说，我们已经厉害的发咒起誓，若不先杀保罗，就不吃什么。<br>They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, We have bound ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>23:15</a></td><td class=td>现在你们连同议会要通知千夫长，叫他带保罗下到你们这里来，假作要更详确审断他的事；我们已经预备好了，不等他走近，就杀掉他。<br>Now therefore you, with the Sanhedrin, notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine more accurately the things concerning him; and we, before he draws near, are ready to do away with him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>23:16</a></td><td class=td>保罗的外甥听见这埋伏的事，就来，进了营楼，告诉保罗。<br>But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered into the barracks and reported it to Paul. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>23:17</a></td><td class=td>保罗请一个百夫长来，说，你带这青年人到千夫长那里，他有事要告诉他。<br>And Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, Bring this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>23:18</a></td><td class=td>于是百夫长拉着他，带到千夫长那里，说，被囚的保罗请我到他那里，求我带这青年人到你这里，他有事要告诉你。<br>So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, The prisoner Paul called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>23:19</a></td><td class=td>千夫长就拉着他的手走到一旁，私下查问说，你有什么事要告诉我？<br>And the commander took him by the hand and, withdrawing privately, inquired, What is it that you have to report to me? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>23:20</a></td><td class=td>他说，犹太人已经约定，要求你明天带保罗下到议会里去，假作要更详确查问他的事。<br>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Sanhedrin, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>23:21</a></td><td class=td>你不要听从他们，因为他们中间有四十多人，埋伏着等待保罗，并且已经发咒起誓，若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝；现在他们预备好了，只等你应允。<br>So you should not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him; they have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have done away with him. And now they are ready, awaiting the promise from you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>23:22</a></td><td class=td>于是千夫长打发那青年人走，嘱咐他说，不要对任何人泄漏，说你将这事通知我了。<br>So the commander dismissed the young man, charging him, Do not tell anyone that you have informed me of these things. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>23:23</a></td><td class=td>千夫长便叫了两个百夫长来，说，预备步兵二百、马兵七十、长枪手二百，今夜九时往该撒利亚去。<br>And he called to him a certain two of the centurions and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, as well as seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>23:24</a></td><td class=td>也要预备牲口叫保罗骑上，把他平安的护送到总督腓力斯那里去。<br>And they were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>23:25</a></td><td class=td>千夫长又写了文书，<br>And he wrote a letter having this form: </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>23:26</a></td><td class=td>大意如下：革老丢吕西亚请总督腓力斯大人安。<br>Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency, Governor Felix, rejoice. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>23:27</a></td><td class=td>这人被犹太人拿住，将要遭害，我得知他是罗马人，就带兵丁到场，把他救出来。<br>This man, having been seized by the Jews and about to be done away with by them, I came upon with my detachment of soldiers and rescued, when I learned that he was a Roman. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>23:28</a></td><td class=td>因为想要确知他们告他的缘故，我就带他下到他们的议会去，<br>And intending to ascertain the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>23:29</a></td><td class=td>便查知他被告，是因他们律法的问题，并没有什么该死该绑的罪名。<br>And found him to be accused concerning questions of their law, but having nothing worthy of death or of bonds laid to his charge. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>23:30</a></td><td class=td>后来有人把要害这人的阴谋告诉我，我就立刻解他到你那里去，又吩咐告他的人，到你面前告他。<br>And when it was disclosed to me that there was a plot against the man, I sent him at once to you, charging the accusers also to speak the things against him before you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>23:31</a></td><td class=td>于是兵丁照所指示他们的，夜里将保罗带到安提帕底。<br>So the soldiers, according to what they had been directed, took up Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>23:32</a></td><td class=td>第二天让马兵同保罗前行，他们就回营楼去了。<br>And on the next day, leaving the horsemen to depart with him, they returned to the barracks. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>23:33</a></td><td class=td>马兵来到该撒利亚，把文书呈给总督，也把保罗带到他面前。<br>And when they entered into Caesarea and handed over the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also to him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>23:34</a></td><td class=td>总督念了，就问保罗是那省的人；既查知他是基利家人，<br>And when he had read it, he asked from what province he was; and learning that he was from Cilicia, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>23:35</a></td><td class=td>就说，等告你的人来到，我要细听你的事。便吩咐人把他看守在希律的王府里。<br>He said, I will hear your case fully when your accusers also arrive. And he ordered him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
