<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>弟兄们，你们自己原晓得，我们进到你们那里，并不是徒然的。<br>For you yourselves know, brothers, our entrance toward you, that it has not been in vain. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>我们从前在腓立比受苦害，又被凌辱，就如你们所知道的，然而还是在我们的神里面放胆，在极大的争战中，对你们讲说了神的福音。<br>But having suffered previously and having been outrageously treated, even as you know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggle. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>我们的劝勉不是出于错谬，不是出于污秽，也不是用诡诈；<br>For our exhortation is not out of deception nor out of uncleanness nor in guile; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>2:4</a></td><td class=td>但神怎样验中了我们，把福音托付我们，我们就照样讲，不是要讨人喜欢，乃是要讨那察验我们心的神喜欢。<br>But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proves our hearts. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>2:5</a></td><td class=td>因为我们从来没有用过谄媚的话，就如你们所知道的；也没有借掩饰而贪婪，这是神可以作见证的。<br>For neither were we found at any time with flattering speech, even as you know, nor with a pretext for covetousness; God is witness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>2:6</a></td><td class=td>我们作基督的使徒，虽然有权利叫人尊重，却没有向你们，或向别人，寻求从人来的荣耀；<br>Nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others, though we could have stood on our authority as apostles of Christ. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>2:7</a></td><td class=td>只在你们中间为人温和，如同乳母顾惜自己的孩子。<br>But we were gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>2:8</a></td><td class=td>我们这样切慕你们，不但乐意将神的福音分给你们，连自己的性命也愿意分给你们，因你们是我们所爱的。<br>Yearning in this way over you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls, because you became beloved to us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>2:9</a></td><td class=td>弟兄们，你们原记得我们的劳碌辛苦；我们是昼夜作工，把神的福音传扬给你们，免得叫你们任何人受累。<br>For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: While working night and day so as not to be burdensome to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>2:10</a></td><td class=td>你们和神可以作见证，我们向你们信的人，是何等圣、义、无可指摘，<br>You are witnesses, as well as God, how in a holy and righteous and blameless manner we conducted ourselves toward you who believe, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>2:11</a></td><td class=td>正如你们所知道的，我们怎样劝勉你们，抚慰你们，向你们作见证，待你们每一个人，好像父亲待自己的孩子一样；<br>Just as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father to his own children, exhorting you and consoling you and testifying, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>2:12</a></td><td class=td>要叫你们行事为人，配得过那召你们进入祂自己的国和荣耀的神。<br>So that you might walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>2:13</a></td><td class=td>所以，我们也不住的感谢神，因为你们既接受了从我们所听见神的话，就不以为是人的话，乃以为是神的话而领受了；这话确是神的，也运行在你们信的人里面。<br>And because of this we also thank God unceasingly that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but even as it truly is, the word of God, which also operates in you who believe. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>2:14</a></td><td class=td>弟兄们，你们曾效法犹太地在基督耶稣里神的众召会；因为你们也受了自己同族人同样的苦害，正如他们从犹太人所受的一样。<br>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they also from the Jews, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>2:15</a></td><td class=td>这些犹太人杀了主耶稣和申言者，又驱逐了我们；他们不得神的喜悦，且与众人敌对；<br>Who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us out; and they are not pleasing to God and are contrary to all men, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>2:16</a></td><td class=td>拦阻我们向外邦人讲道，使他们得救，以致常常充满自己的罪。忿怒临到他们身上，已经到了极处。<br>In that they forbid us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so that they fill up their sins always. But wrath has come upon them to the uttermost. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>2:17</a></td><td class=td>弟兄们，我们如同丧失亲人一般，暂时与你们分离，是面目的，不是心里的，我们越发急切，极其巴望要见你们的面。<br>But we, brothers, having been bereaved of you for a little while, in presence, not in heart, were more abundantly eager with great desire to see your face. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>2:18</a></td><td class=td>所以我们有意到你们那里，我保罗确曾一次两次要去，只是撒但拦阻了我们。<br>Therefore we wanted to come to you, indeed I Paul, both once and again, yet Satan hindered us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>2:19</a></td><td class=td>我们主耶稣来临的时候，我们在祂面前的盼望、喜乐、或所夸的冠冕是什么？不就是你们么？<br>For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at His coming? Are not even you? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>2:20</a></td><td class=td>因为你们就是我们的荣耀、我们的喜乐。<br>For you are our glory and joy. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
