Solomon clung to these in love.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>11:14</a></td><td class=td>耶和华使以东人哈达兴起，作所罗门的对头；他是以东王的后裔。<br>And Jehovah raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king's seed in Edom.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>11:18</a></td><td class=td>他们从米甸起行，到了巴兰；从巴兰带着几个人，来到埃及见埃及王法老；法老给他房屋，为他派定粮食，又给他田地。<br>Thus they arose from Midian and went to Paran, and they took men from Paran with them and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who gave him a house and appointed him a portion of food and gave him land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>11:19</a></td><td class=td>哈达在法老眼前大蒙恩惠，以致法老将自己妻子的妹妹，就是王后答比匿的妹妹，赐他为妻。<br>And Hadad found so much favor in the sight of Pharaoh that Pharaoh gave him the sister of his wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen, as his wife.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>11:20</a></td><td class=td>答比匿的妹妹给哈达生了儿子基努拔；答比匿使基努拔在法老的宫里断奶，基努拔就在法老的宫里，在法老的众子中生活。<br>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, and Tahpenes weaned him in Pharaoh's house, and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among Pharaoh's sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>11:21</a></td><td class=td>哈达在埃及听见大卫与他列祖同睡，元帅约押也死了，就对法老说，求你让我离开，往我本地去。<br>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart that I may go to my own land.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>11:23</a></td><td class=td>神又使以利亚大的儿子利逊兴起，作所罗门的对头；他先前逃避主人琐巴王哈大底谢。<br>And God raised up another adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer the king of Zobah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>11:24</a></td><td class=td>大卫击杀琐巴人的时候，利逊招聚了一群人在身边，自己作他们的头目，往大马色居住，在那里作王。<br>And he gathered men to himself and became the captain of the band when David slew those of Zobah; and they went to Damascus and dwelt there; and they reigned in Damascus.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>11:25</a></td><td class=td>所罗门在世的一切日子，哈达为患之外，利逊也作以色列的对头；他恨恶以色列人，且作了亚兰人的王。<br>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon in addition to the evil that Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel and reigned over Syria.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>11:26</a></td><td class=td>所罗门的臣仆，尼八的儿子耶罗波安也举手攻击王；他是洗利达的以法莲人，他母亲是寡妇，名叫洗鲁阿。<br>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, also a widow, lifted up his hand against the king.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>11:27</a></td><td class=td>他举手攻击王的缘故是这样：先前所罗门建造米罗，修补他父亲大卫的城的破口。<br>And this was the reason he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon was building the Millo, closing up the breach of the city of David his father.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>11:28</a></td><td class=td>耶罗波安是个有才能的人；所罗门见这少年人殷勤，就派他监管约瑟家一切服苦役的人。<br>And the man Jeroboam was an able man; and Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, so he set him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>11:29</a></td><td class=td>那时，有一次耶罗波安出了耶路撒冷，示罗人申言者亚希雅在路上遇见他。亚希雅穿着一件新衣；他们二人在田野，以外并无别人。<br>And at that time Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the way. And  Ahijah was wearing a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the field.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>11:31</a></td><td class=td>对耶罗波安说，你给自己拿十片；因为耶和华以色列的神如此说，我必将国从所罗门手里撕去，将十个支派赐给你，<br>And he said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces for yourself; for thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, I am now tearing the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and giving the ten tribes to you</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>11:32</a></td><td class=td>(但因我仆人大卫，和我在以色列众支派中所选择的耶路撒冷城的缘故，所罗门仍然可以有一个支派，)<br>(But the one tribe will be his because of My servant David and because of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>11:33</a></td><td class=td>因为他们离弃我，敬拜西顿人的女神亚斯他录、摩押的神基抹、和亚扪人的神米勒公，没有遵行我的道路，行我眼中看为正的事，守我的律例和典章，像他父亲大卫一样。<br>Because they have forsaken Me and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Chemosh the god of Moab and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon and have not walked in My ways by doing what is upright in My sight and by keeping My statutes and My ordinances as David his father did.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>11:34</a></td><td class=td>但我不从他手里将全国夺去；我必使他终身为君，这是因着我所拣选的仆人大卫的缘故，因他谨守我的诫命和律例。<br>But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him leader all the days of his life because of David My servant, whom I chose and who kept My commandments and My statutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>11:35</a></td><td class=td>我必从他儿子的手里将国夺去，把这国十个支派赐给你，<br>Yet I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give it to you, that is, the ten tribes;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>11:36</a></td><td class=td>还将一个支派留给他的儿子，使我仆人大卫在我所选择立我名的耶路撒冷城里，在我面前一直有灯光。<br>And to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may have a lamp always before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put My name.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>11:37</a></td><td class=td>我必选取你，使你照心里一切所愿的掌权，作王治理以色列。<br>And I will take you, and you will reign according to all that your soul desires; and you will be king over Israel.</td></tr>
