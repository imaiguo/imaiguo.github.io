<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>25:25</a></td><td class=td>我主不要把这卑劣之人拿八放在心上，他的名字怎样，为人也怎样；他名叫拿八，他为人果然愚顽。但我主所打发的少年人，婢女并没有看见。<br>May my lord not take this worthless man Nabal to heart. For as his name is, so he is: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your female servant did not see my lord's young men, whom you sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>25:26</a></td><td class=td>我主阿，耶和华既然阻止你流人的血，阻止你亲手报仇，所以我指着永活的耶和华起誓，并指着你的性命起誓，说，愿你的仇敌和谋害我主的人，都像拿八一样。<br>And now, my lord, as Jehovah lives and as your soul lives, since Jehovah has withheld you from entering into bloodshed and from avenging yourself by your own hand, now therefore let your enemies and those who seek harm against my lord be like Nabal.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>25:32</a></td><td class=td>大卫对亚比该说，耶和华以色列的神是当受颂赞的，因为祂今日打发你来迎接我。<br>And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me.</td></tr>
