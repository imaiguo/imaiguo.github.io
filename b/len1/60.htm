Let My people go that they may serve Me.</td></tr>

Let the men go that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is destroyed?</td></tr>

And they ate all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, and nothing green remained on the trees or among the vegetation of the field throughout all the land of Egypt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>10:16</a></td><td class=td>于是法老急忙召了摩西、亚伦来，说，我得罪了耶和华你们的神，又得罪了你们。<br>Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron and said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>10:20</a></td><td class=td>但耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不让以色列人去。<br>But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>10:22</a></td><td class=td>摩西向天伸手，埃及遍地就漆黑了三天。<br>So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness throughout all the land of Egypt for three days.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>10:25</a></td><td class=td>摩西说，你也得使我们有祭物和燔祭牲，我们好献祭给耶和华我们的神。<br>And Moses said, You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings so that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>10:27</a></td><td class=td>但耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不愿让他们去。<br>But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.</td></tr>
