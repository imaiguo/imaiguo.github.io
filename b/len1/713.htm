<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>34:2</a></td><td class=td>因为耶和华的忿怒临到万国，祂的烈怒临到他们的全军；祂已将他们灭尽，交出他们受杀戮。<br>For Jehovah's indignation is upon all the nations, And His wrath is upon all their armies; He has utterly destroyed them; He has delivered them unto the slaughter.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>34:3</a></td><td class=td>他们被杀的必被抛弃，尸首臭气上腾；诸山被他们的血融化。<br>Thus their slain are cast away, And from their corpses their stench will come up; And the mountains will be melted with their blood.</td></tr>
