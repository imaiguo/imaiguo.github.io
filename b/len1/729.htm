Or to which of My creditors Have I sold you? Indeed, for your iniquities you were sold, And for your transgressions your mother was put away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>50:2</a></td><td class=td>我来的时候，为何无人等候？我呼唤的时候，为何无人答应？我的手臂岂是缩短，不能救赎么？我岂无拯救之力么？看哪，我一斥责，海就干了；<br>Why when I came was  there no man? And when I called why was there no one to answer? Is My hand so short that it cannot redeem? Or do I have no power to deliver? Indeed, at My rebuke I dry up the  sea; I make the rivers a wilderness; Their fish stink because there is no water, And die of thirst.</td></tr>

He awakens me morning by morning; He awakens my ear To hear as an instructed one.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>50:7</a></td><td class=td>主耶和华必帮助我，所以我不抱愧；我硬着脸面好像坚石，我也知道我必不至蒙羞。<br>The Lord Jehovah helps me; Therefore I have not been dishonored; Therefore I have set my face like a flint, And I know that I will not be put to shame.</td></tr>

You will have this from My hand: You will lie down in torment.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
