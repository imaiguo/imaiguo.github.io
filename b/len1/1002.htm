<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>在耶路撒冷靠近羊门有一个池子，希伯来话叫作毕士大，旁边有五个廊子。<br>Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheepgate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>里面躺着许多病弱的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的、枯干的，等候水动。<br>In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>因为有天使时常下池子搅动那水，水动之后，谁先下去，无论患什么病，都会痊愈。<br>For an angel went down from time to time in the pool and stirred up the water; the first then to step in after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was being held by. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>在那里有一个人，病了三十八年。<br>And a certain man was there, who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>耶稣看见他躺着，知道他已经病了许久，就问他说，你想要痊愈么？<br>When Jesus saw this one lying there and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, Do you want to get well? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>病人回答说，先生，水动的时候，没有人把我放在池子里；我正去的时候，总有别人比我先下去。<br>The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>那人立即痊愈，就拿起褥子走了。<br>And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>那天是安息日，所以犹太人对那治好的人说，今天是安息日，你拿褥子是不可的。<br>Therefore the Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>5:11</a></td><td class=td>他却回答说，那使我痊愈的对我说，拿你的褥子走吧。<br>But he answered them, He who made me well, that One said to me, Take up your mat and walk. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>5:15</a></td><td class=td>那人就去告诉犹太人，使他痊愈的是耶稣。<br>The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the One who made him well. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>所以犹太人逼迫耶稣，想要杀祂，因为祂在安息日作了这事。<br>And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>5:17</a></td><td class=td>耶稣就对他们说，我父作工直到如今，我也作工。<br>But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I also am working. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>5:18</a></td><td class=td>所以犹太人就越发想要杀祂，因祂不但犯了安息日，并且称神为祂的父，将自己与神当作平等。<br>Because of this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>5:19</a></td><td class=td>耶稣对他们说，我实实在在的告诉你们，子从自己不能作什么，惟有看见父所作的，子才能作；父所作的事，子也照样作。<br>Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>5:20</a></td><td class=td>父爱子，将自己所作的一切事指示祂，还要将比这更大的事指示祂，叫你们希奇。<br>For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and greater works than these He will show Him that you may marvel. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>5:21</a></td><td class=td>父怎样叫死人起来，赐他们生命，子也照样随自己的意思赐人生命。<br>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>5:22</a></td><td class=td>父也不审判什么人，乃将审判的事全交与子，<br>For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>5:23</a></td><td class=td>叫人都尊敬子，如同尊敬父一样。不尊敬子的，就是不尊敬差子来的父。<br>In order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>5:24</a></td><td class=td>我实实在在的告诉你们，那听我话，又信差我来者的，就有永远的生命，不至于受审判，乃是已经出死入生了。<br>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>5:25</a></td><td class=td>我实实在在的告诉你们，时候将到，如今就是了，死人要听见神儿子的声音，听见的人就要活了。<br>Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>5:26</a></td><td class=td>因为父怎样在自己里面有生命，就赐给子也照样在自己里面有生命；<br>For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>5:27</a></td><td class=td>并且因为祂是人子，就赐给祂行审判的权柄。<br>And He gave Him authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>5:28</a></td><td class=td>你们不要把这事看作希奇，因为时候将到，凡在坟墓里的，都要听见祂的声音，就出来；<br>Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>5:29</a></td><td class=td>行善的归到生命的复活，作恶的归到审判的复活。<br>And will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>5:30</a></td><td class=td>我从自己不能作什么；我怎么听见，就怎么审判；我的审判也是公平的，因为我不寻求自己的意思，只寻求那差我来者的意思。<br>I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>5:31</a></td><td class=td>我若为自己作见证，我的见证就不真。<br>If I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is not true. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>5:34</a></td><td class=td>其实我不接受从人来的见证；然而我说这些话，为要叫你们得救。<br>But it is not from man that I receive My testimony, but I say these things that you may be saved. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>5:35</a></td><td class=td>约翰是点着且发亮的灯，你们情愿暂时在他的光中欢腾。<br>He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to exult for a while in his light. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>5:36</a></td><td class=td>但我有比约翰更大的见证，因为父交给我要我完成的工，就是我所作的这些工，为我作见证，我是父所差来的。<br>But I have the testimony which is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>5:37</a></td><td class=td>差我来的父，也为我作过见证。你们从来没有听过祂的声音，也没有见过祂的形状，<br>And the Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>5:38</a></td><td class=td>并且你们没有祂的话住在你们里面，因为祂所差来的这一位，你们不信。<br>And you do not have His word abiding in you, for Him whom He sent, this One you do not believe. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>5:39</a></td><td class=td>你们查考圣经，因你们以为其中有永远的生命，为我作见证的就是这经。<br>You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=40>5:40</a></td><td class=td>然而你们不肯到我这里来得生命。<br>Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=41>5:41</a></td><td class=td>我不接受从人来的荣耀。<br>I do not receive glory from men. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=42>5:42</a></td><td class=td>但我认识你们，知道你们里面没有神的爱。<br>But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. </td></tr>
