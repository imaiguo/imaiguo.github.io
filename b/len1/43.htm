<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>43:6</a></td><td class=td>以色列说，你们为什么这样害我，告诉那人你们还有弟弟呢？<br>And Israel said, Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>43:7</a></td><td class=td>他们说，那人详细的问到我们和我们的亲属，说，你们的父亲还健在么？你们还有兄弟么？我们就按着他所问的告诉他。我们怎能知道他会说，把你们的弟弟带下来呢？<br>And they said, The man asked very carefully about us and about our relatives, saying, Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother? So we told him about these things. Could we possibly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>43:17</a></td><td class=td>家宰就遵着约瑟的命去行，领他们进约瑟的屋里。<br>And the man did as Joseph said, and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>43:18</a></td><td class=td>他们因为被领到约瑟的屋里，就害怕，说，必是因为头次归还在我们袋子里的银子，才领我们到这里来，要找机会下手害我们，强取我们作奴仆，抢夺我们的驴。<br>And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, It is because of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are being brought in, that he may come out against us and fall upon us and take us as slaves with our donkeys.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>43:19</a></td><td class=td>他们就挨近约瑟的家宰，在屋门口和他说话，<br>And they came near to the man who was over Joseph's house and spoke to him at the door of the house,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>43:20</a></td><td class=td>说，我主阿，我们头次下来实在是要买粮食。<br>And said, Please, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy grain for food;</td></tr>

Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; your silver came to me. Then he brought Simeon out to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>43:24</a></td><td class=td>家宰就领他们进约瑟的屋里，给他们水洗脚，又给他们饲粮喂驴。<br>And the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>43:25</a></td><td class=td>他们就豫备礼物，等候约瑟正午来，因为他们听见要在那里吃饭。<br>And they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they had heard that they would eat a meal there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>43:26</a></td><td class=td>约瑟来到家里，他们就把手中的礼物拿进屋去给他，又俯伏在地，向他下拜。<br>And when Joseph came into the house, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed down to the ground to him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>43:27</a></td><td class=td>约瑟问他们安，又说，你们的父亲，就是你们所说的那老人家平安么？他还健在么？<br>And he asked them about their welfare and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>43:28</a></td><td class=td>他们回答说，你仆人我们的父亲平安；他还健在。于是他们低头下拜。<br>And they said, Your servant our father is well; he is still alive. And they bowed and paid him homage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>43:29</a></td><td class=td>约瑟举目看见他同母的弟弟便雅悯，就说，你们向我所说那最小的弟弟，就是这位么？又说，小儿阿，愿神赐恩给你。<br>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>43:30</a></td><td class=td>约瑟爱弟之情发动，就急忙寻找可哭之处，进入自己的内室，哭了一场。<br>And Joseph hurried-for his inward parts burned for his brother-and sought a place to weep. So he entered into his chamber and wept there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>43:31</a></td><td class=td>他洗了脸出来，勉强忍住，吩咐人摆饭。<br>Then he washed his face and came out, and he controlled himself and said, Serve the meal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>43:32</a></td><td class=td>他们就为约瑟单摆了一席，为那些人又摆了一席，也为和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人另摆了一席，因为埃及人不可和希伯来人一同吃饭；那原是埃及人所厌恶的。<br>And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat a meal with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>43:33</a></td><td class=td>约瑟使众弟兄在他面前坐席，都按着长幼的次序，众弟兄就彼此惊奇相看。<br>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.</td></tr>
