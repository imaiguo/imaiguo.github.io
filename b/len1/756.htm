<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>11:5</a></td><td class=td>我好坚定向你们列祖所起的誓，给他们流奶与蜜之地，正如今日一样。我就回答说，耶和华阿，阿们。<br>That I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said, Amen, Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>11:6</a></td><td class=td>耶和华对我说，你要在犹大城邑中，和耶路撒冷街道上，宣告这一切话，说，你们当听从遵行这约的话。<br>And Jehovah said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant and do them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>11:7</a></td><td class=td>因为我将你们列祖从埃及地领上来的那日，曾郑重的警戒他们；直到今日，都是从早起来警戒他们，说，你们当听从我的话。<br>For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising up early and warning, saying, Listen to My voice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>11:8</a></td><td class=td>他们却不听从，不侧耳而听，竟都按自己顽梗的恶心而行；所以我使这约中一切咒诅的话临到他们，这约是我吩咐他们行的，他们却不去行。<br>But they did not listen or incline their ear, but all walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart; therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, and they have not done them.</td></tr>
