And he went to a bare height.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>23:9</a></td><td class=td>我从高峰看他，从小山望他；这是独居的民，不将自己算在万民中。<br>For from the top of the rocks I see him,  And from the hills I behold him. Here is a people who live alone And do not reckon themselves  among the nations.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>23:10</a></td><td class=td>谁能数算雅各的尘土？谁能数点以色列的四分之一？愿我之死如正直人之死；愿我之终如正直人之终。<br>Who can count the dust of Jacob,  Or number the fourth part of Israel?  Let me die the death of the upright, And let my latter end be like theirs!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>23:11</a></td><td class=td>巴勒对巴兰说，你向我作的是什么事？我领你来咒诅我的仇敌，不料，你竟完全为他们祝福。<br>And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed  them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>23:12</a></td><td class=td>他回答说，耶和华放在我口中的话，我能不谨慎讲说么？<br>And he answered and said, Shall I not take care to speak what Jehovah puts in my mouth?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>23:13</a></td><td class=td>巴勒说，求你同我往另一处去，你从那里可以看见他们；你不能看见他们全部，只能看见他们营的边缘。你要从那里为我咒诅他们。<br>And Balak said to him, Come now with me to another place from which you may see them. You will see only the outside edge of them and not see them all; then curse them for me from there.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>23:18</a></td><td class=td>巴兰便题起诗歌说，巴勒阿，你起来听；西拨的儿子阿，你向我侧耳。<br>And he took up his parable and said, Arise, O Balak, and hear;  Listen to me, O son of Zippor:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>23:19</a></td><td class=td>神并非人，必不至说谎，也非人子，必不至后悔。祂说话，岂能不作成？祂发言，岂能不立定？<br>God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not establish it?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>23:21</a></td><td class=td>祂未见雅各中有罪孽，也未见以色列中有祸患；耶和华他们的神与他们同在，有向王欢呼的声音在他们中间。<br>He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, Nor has He seen trouble in Israel; Jehovah their God is with them, And the shout of a king is among them.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>23:25</a></td><td class=td>巴勒对巴兰说，那么你一点不要咒诅他们，也一点不要为他们祝福。<br>And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.</td></tr>
