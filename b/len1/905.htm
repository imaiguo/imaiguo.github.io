<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>耶和华回答说，将这异象明明的写在版上，使读的人容易读。<br>Then Jehovah answered and said, Write the vision, and render it  plainly upon tablets,  That even he who runs by may read it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>因为这异象有一定的时期，快要达到终局，并非虚谎；虽然迟延，还要等候；因为必然临到，不再耽延。<br>For the vision is yet for the appointed time, And it hastens toward the end and will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; For it will surely come; it will not delay.</td></tr>

And who loads himself with the burden of pledges?</td></tr>

You also, drink and be shown to be uncircumcised! The cup of Jehovah's right hand will come around to you, And disgrace will be upon your glory.</td></tr>
