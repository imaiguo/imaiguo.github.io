<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>14:1</a></td><td class=td>洗鲁雅的儿子约押，知道王的心挂念押沙龙，<br>And Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was  set on Absalom.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>14:2</a></td><td class=td>就打发人往提哥亚去，从那里带了一个聪明的妇人来，对她说，请你假装居丧的，穿上丧服，不要用油抹身，要装作为死者居丧多日的妇人；<br>So Joab sent  word to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. And he said to her, Pretend to be in mourning, and put on mourning garments, and do not anoint yourself with oil; but be like a woman who has mourned for the dead a long time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>14:3</a></td><td class=td>进去见王，对王如此如此说。于是约押将当说的话教导了妇人。<br>And go to the king and speak with him in this way. And Joab put the words in her mouth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>14:4</a></td><td class=td>提哥亚妇人进去对王说话；她面伏于地叩拜，说，王阿，求你拯救！<br>And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and paid  him homage and said, Help, O king!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>14:5</a></td><td class=td>王问她说，你有什么事？她说，我实在是寡妇，我丈夫死了。<br>And the king said to her, What troubles you? And she said, Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>14:6</a></td><td class=td>你婢女有两个儿子，一日他们二人在田间争斗，没有人从中排解，这个就把那个打死了。<br>And your servant had two sons. And the two struggled with each other in the field, and there was no one to part them. So the one struck down the other and killed him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>14:7</a></td><td class=td>现在全家族的人都起来攻击你的婢女，说，你将那打死兄弟的交出来，我们好将他处死，偿他所打死兄弟的命；即使是承受家业的，我们也要灭绝。这样，他们要将我剩下的炭火灭尽，不给我丈夫留名留后在地上。<br>And now the whole family has risen up against your servant, and they say, Give over that one who struck down his brother that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he has slain, even if we destroy the heir also. Thus they will quench my coal which is left without leaving to my husband a name or a remainder on the face of the earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>14:8</a></td><td class=td>王对妇人说，你回家去罢，我必为你下令。<br>Then the king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will issue a command concerning you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>14:9</a></td><td class=td>提哥亚妇人又对王说，我主我王，愿这罪孽归我和我父家，与王和王的位无干。<br>And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, O my lord the king, the iniquity be upon me and upon the house of my father, and the king and his throne be guiltless.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>14:10</a></td><td class=td>王说，对你说这事的，你就带他到我这里来，他必不再打扰你。<br>And the king said, If anyone says  anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>14:11</a></td><td class=td>妇人说，愿王记念耶和华你的神，不许报血仇的人施行杀灭，恐怕他们灭绝我的儿子。王说，我指着永活的耶和华起誓，你的儿子连一根头发也不至落在地上。<br>And she said, May the king remember Jehovah your God, so that the avenger of blood may kill no more and they destroy not my son. And he said, As Jehovah lives, not a hair from your son shall fall to the ground.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>14:12</a></td><td class=td>妇人说，请让婢女向我主我王说一句话。王说，你说罢。<br>Then the woman said, Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>14:13</a></td><td class=td>妇人说，王为何想出这样的事，要害神的民呢？王不使他所赶逐的那人回来，王说这话就不免有罪了。<br>And the woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word, the king is like one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring back his banished one.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>14:14</a></td><td class=td>我们都是必死的，如同水泼在地上，不能收回。神并不夺取人的性命，乃设法使被赶逐的人不至被赶逐永远离开祂。<br>For we must die and are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered  again. Yet God does not take away life, but devises ways that the banished one would not be cast out from Him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>14:15</a></td><td class=td>如今我来将这话告诉我主我王，是因百姓使我惧怕；婢女想，让我告诉王，也许王会成就婢女所求的。<br>Now therefore that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people made me afraid; and your servant said, I will now speak to the king; perhaps the king will perform his servant's request.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>14:16</a></td><td class=td>人要将我和我儿子从神的产业中一同除灭，王必应允救婢女脱离那人的手。<br>For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>14:17</a></td><td class=td>婢女又想，愿我主我王的话安慰我；因为我主我王能辨别善恶，如同神的使者一样。惟愿耶和华你的神与你同在。<br>Then your servant said, Let the word of my lord the king be a comfort  to me, for as an angel of God is, so is my lord the king in discerning good and evil; and may Jehovah your God be with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>14:18</a></td><td class=td>王回答妇人说，我要问你一件事，你不要瞒着我。妇人说，愿我主我王说。<br>And the king answered and said to the woman, Do not hide the matter from me which I will ask of you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king speak.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>14:19</a></td><td class=td>王说，这一切事莫非是约押一手安排的么？妇人回答说，我主我王阿，我指着你的性命起誓，我主我王的话正对，不偏左右，是王的仆人约押吩咐我的，这一切话是他教导你婢女的。<br>And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered and said, As your soul lives, O my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or left of anything that my lord the king has said; for your servant Joab commanded me, and it is he who has put all these words in the mouth of your servant.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>14:20</a></td><td class=td>你的仆人约押行这事，为要使事情有转圜；我主却有智慧，如神使者的智慧一样，能知地上一切的事。<br>In order to change the appearance of the matter, your servant Joab did this thing; and my lord is wise, as wise as an angel of God, knowing all that there is in the land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>14:21</a></td><td class=td>王对约押说，看哪，我应允你这事。你可以去，把那少年人押沙龙带回来。<br>Then the king said to Joab, I will now do this thing; go therefore,  and bring the young man Absalom back.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>14:22</a></td><td class=td>约押就面伏于地叩拜，称谢王，又说，王既应允仆人的事，我主我王阿，你仆人今日知道自己在你眼前蒙恩了。<br>And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king; and Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, O my lord the king, in that the king has granted his servant's request.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>14:23</a></td><td class=td>于是约押起身往基述去，将押沙龙带回耶路撒冷。<br>Then Joab rose up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>14:24</a></td><td class=td>王说，使他回自己家里去，不要见我的面。押沙龙就回自己家里去，没有见王的面。<br>And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the king's face.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>14:25</a></td><td class=td>全以色列之中，无人像押沙龙那样俊美，大得人的称赞；他从脚底到头顶毫无瑕疵。<br>Now there was none in Israel to be praised more greatly for his beauty than Absalom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>14:26</a></td><td class=td>他每到年底剪发一次；因为头上积发甚重，他就剪去；他把每次剪下的头发称一称，按王的法码重二百舍客勒。<br>And when he cut  the hair of his head (and it was at the end of each year that he cut  it, for it became heavy on him and he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, according to the king's weight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>14:27</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙得了三个儿子，一个女儿；女儿名叫他玛，是个容貌美丽的女子。<br>And to Absalom were born three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>14:28</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙住在耶路撒冷足有二年，没有见王的面。<br>And Absalom dwelt in Jerusalem for two full years and did not see the king's face.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>14:29</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙打发人去叫约押来，要差他去见王，约押却不肯来。第二次打发人去叫他，他仍不肯来。<br>Then Absalom sent for Joab so that he might send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And he sent  for him yet a second time, but he would not come.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>14:30</a></td><td class=td>所以押沙龙对仆人说，你们看，约押有一块田，与我的田相近，他有大麦在那里，你们去放火烧了。押沙龙的仆人就去放火烧了那块田。<br>Then he said to his servants, See, Joab's portion of land is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. So Absalom's servants set the portion of land on fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>14:31</a></td><td class=td>于是约押起来，到押沙龙家里，问他说，你的仆人为何放火烧了我的那块田呢？<br>And Joab rose up and came to Absalom at his house; and he said to him, Why did your servants set my portion of land on fire?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>14:32</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙对约押说，我打发人去见你，说，请你来，我要差你去见王，替我说，我为何从基述回来呢？不如仍在那里。现在请让我见王的面；我身上若有罪孽，任凭王把我处死就是了。<br>And Absalom said to Joab, I sent for you, saying, Come now that I may send you to the king to say, Why have I come from Geshur? It would have been better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is any iniquity in me, let him put me to death.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>14:33</a></td><td class=td>于是约押去见王，将这话奏告王，王便叫押沙龙来。押沙龙来见王，在王面前面伏于地叩拜，王就与押沙龙亲嘴。<br>So Joab went to the king and spoke to him, and he called for Absalom. And he came to the king and bowed himself with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
