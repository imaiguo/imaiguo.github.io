<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>2:1</a></td><td class=td>主何竟发怒，使乌云遮蔽锡安的女子！祂将以色列的华美，从天扔在地上，在祂发怒的日子，并不记念自己的脚凳。<br>How the Lord in His anger Has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud! He has cast from heaven to earth The glory of Israel, And has not remembered His  footstool In the day of His anger.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>2:2</a></td><td class=td>主吞灭雅各一切的住处，并不顾惜；祂在盛怒中拆毁了犹大女子的保障，使这保障坍倒在地；祂辱没这国和其首领。<br>The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob; He has not spared; He has torn down in His overflowing wrath The strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He has brought them down to the ground; He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>2:3</a></td><td class=td>祂在烈怒中，把以色列的角全然砍断。祂在仇敌面前收回右手。祂像火焰四围吞灭，在雅各中间焚烧。<br>He has cut off in fierce anger All the horn of Israel. He has withdrawn His right hand From before the enemy. He has burned among Jacob like a flame of fire; It consumes all around.</td></tr>

In the tent of the daughter of Zion He has poured out His wrath like fire.</td></tr>

What shall I liken you to, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare you to, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your breach is great like a sea. Who will heal you?</td></tr>
