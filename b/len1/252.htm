Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have  for Myself a king among his sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>16:2</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳说，我怎能去呢？扫罗若听见，必要杀我。耶和华说，你可以牵一只母牛犊去，说，我来是要向耶和华献祭。<br>And Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul hears  of  it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>16:5</a></td><td class=td>他说，是为平安；我来是要向耶和华献祭。你们当使自己分别为圣，来与我同赴献祭的筵席。撒母耳就使耶西和他众子分别为圣，请他们来赴献祭的筵席。<br>And he said, Peaceably. I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>16:7</a></td><td class=td>耶和华却对撒母耳说，不要看他的外貌和他身材高大，我不拣选他。因为要紧的不是人怎样看；人是看外貌，耶和华是看内心。<br>But Jehovah said to Samuel, Do not regard his appearance and the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For  it is not how man sees  that matters; for man looks on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks on the heart.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>16:11</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳对耶西说，你的孩子们都在这里么？他说，还有那最小的，正在放羊。撒母耳对耶西说，你打发人去带他来；他若不到这里来，我们必不坐席。<br>Then Samuel said to Jesse, Are these all the young men  you have? And he said, There is still the youngest, but he is now tending the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send for  him, and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>16:12</a></td><td class=td>耶西就打发人去带了他来。他面色红润，双目清秀，容貌俊美。耶和华说，这就是他，你起来膏他。<br>So he sent for  him and brought him in. Now he was ruddy  and had beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise; anoint him, for this is he.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>16:13</a></td><td class=td>撒母耳就拿起盛膏油的角，在他诸兄中膏了他；从那日起，耶和华的灵就冲击大卫。于是撒母耳起身往拉玛去了。<br>And Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers, and the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon David from that day forward. Then Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</td></tr>

Your servants are before you; they will seek out a man who is skilled in playing the lyre. And when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play  it by hand, and you will be well.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>16:17</a></td><td class=td>扫罗对臣仆说，你们可以为我看定一个善于弹琴的，带到我这里来。<br>And Saul said to his servants, Select for me a man who can play well, and bring  him to me.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>16:19</a></td><td class=td>于是扫罗差遣使者去见耶西，说，请你打发你放羊的儿子大卫到我这里来。<br>So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David your son, who is among the sheep.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>16:20</a></td><td class=td>耶西就牵来一头驴，驮上饼，和一皮袋酒，并一只山羊羔，交在他儿子大卫手中，送与扫罗。<br>And Jesse took a donkey  laden with bread and a skin of wine and a kid, and sent  them by David his son to Saul.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>16:21</a></td><td class=td>大卫到了扫罗那里，就侍立在扫罗面前。扫罗甚喜爱他，他就作了扫罗拿兵器的人。<br>And David came to Saul and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor bearer.</td></tr>
