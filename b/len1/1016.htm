<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>19:5</a></td><td class=td>耶稣出来，戴着荆棘冠冕，穿着紫袍。彼拉多对他们说，看哪，这个人。<br>Then Jesus came out, wearing the thorny crown and the purple garment. And he said to them, Behold, the man! </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>19:6</a></td><td class=td>祭司长和差役看见祂，就喊着说，钉祂十字架！钉祂十字架！彼拉多说，你们自己把祂带去钉十字架吧，因为我查不出祂有什么该定罪的。<br>When therefore the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I do not find fault in Him. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>19:19</a></td><td class=td>彼拉多又写了一个标示，安在十字架上，写的是：犹太人的王拿撒勒人耶稣。<br>And Pilate wrote a notice also and put it on the cross; and it was written, Jesus The Nazarene, The King Of The JEWS. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>19:20</a></td><td class=td>有许多犹太人念这标示，因为耶稣被钉十字架的地方与城相近，并且这标示是用希伯来文、罗马文、希利尼文写的。<br>This notice therefore many of the Jews read, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>19:21</a></td><td class=td>犹太人的祭司长就对彼拉多说，不要写犹太人的王；要写这个人自己说，我是犹太人的王。<br>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but that He said, I am the King of the JEWS. </td></tr>

But the tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>19:24</a></td><td class=td>他们就彼此说，我们不要撕开，只要拈阄，看谁得着。这是要应验经书：“他们分了我的外衣，又为我的衣服拈阄。”兵丁果然作了这事。<br>They said therefore to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it to see whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, "They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots.'' So then the soldiers did these things. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>19:28</a></td><td class=td>这事以后，耶稣知道各样的事已经成就，为要成就经书，就说，我渴了。<br>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had now been finished and so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>19:29</a></td><td class=td>有一个器皿盛满了醋，放在那里；他们就拿海绵蘸满了醋，绑在牛膝草上，送到祂口边。<br>There was lying there a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>19:30</a></td><td class=td>耶稣受了那醋，就说，成了！便低下头，将灵交付了。<br>Then when Jesus had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and delivered up His spirit. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>19:32</a></td><td class=td>于是兵丁来，把头一个人的腿，并与耶稣同钉另一个人的腿，都打断了；<br>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other man who had been crucified with Him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>19:33</a></td><td class=td>只是来到耶稣那里，见祂已经死了，就不打断祂的腿。<br>But coming to Jesus, when they saw that He had already died, they did not break His legs; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>19:34</a></td><td class=td>惟有一个兵用枪扎祂的肋旁，随即有血和水流出来。<br>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>19:36</a></td><td class=td>这些事发生，为要应验经书：“祂的骨头，一根也不可折断。”<br>For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: "No bone of His shall be broken.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>19:37</a></td><td class=td>另有一处经书说，“他们要仰望自己所扎的人。”<br>And again another Scripture says, "They shall look on Him whom they pierced.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>19:38</a></td><td class=td>这些事以后，有亚利马太人约瑟，是耶稣的门徒，只因怕犹太人，就暗暗的作门徒，他求彼拉多，要领耶稣的身体，彼拉多准许了，他就来把耶稣的身体领去。<br>And after these things Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a hidden one for fear of the Jews, requested of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus away; and Pilate allowed it.
