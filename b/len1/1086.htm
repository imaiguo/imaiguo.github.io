<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>就是在患难中受大试验的时候，他们充盈的喜乐，和极深的贫困，汇溢出丰厚的慷慨。<br>That in much proving of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>我可以见证，他们是按着能力，而且也过了能力，<br>That according to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, of their own accord, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>8:4</a></td><td class=td>自愿的多方恳求，向我们要求这供给圣徒的恩典和交通，<br>With much entreaty they besought of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>并且他们未照着我们所盼望的，反而凭着神的旨意，先把自己给了主，也给了我们，<br>And this, not as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>以致我们劝提多，他怎样开始了，也当照样为你们完成这恩典，像完成其他的事一样。<br>So we entreated Titus that, even as he began before, so also he would complete for you this grace as well. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>但你们当在这恩典上也充盈满溢，像你们在凡事上，在信心，在言语，在知识，在一切的热诚，并在那出于我们而在你们里面的爱心上，都充盈满溢一样。<br>But just as you abound in everything, in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love in you from us, abound in this grace also. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>我说这话，不是命令你们，乃是借着别人的热诚，也试验你们爱的真实。<br>I am not speaking by way of command but through the earnestness of others, proving also the genuineness of your love. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>8:9</a></td><td class=td>你们知道我们主耶稣基督的恩典，祂本来富足，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因祂的贫穷，可以成为富足。<br>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become rich. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>我在这事上提出意见，因这是与你们有益的；你们不但在实行上，也在意愿上，在一年前就先开始了，<br>And I give my opinion in this matter, for this is profitable for you who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this but even to intend to do this. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>8:11</a></td><td class=td>如今也当办成这事，好叫你们怎样有愿作的热切，也怎样照所有的办成，<br>But now complete also the doing, so that as there was the eagerness in intending, so also there would be the completing out of what you have. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>8:12</a></td><td class=td>因为人若热切愿作，必蒙悦纳，乃是照他所有的，不是照他所无的。<br>For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>8:13</a></td><td class=td>这原不是要别人轻省，你们为难，<br>For it is not that to others there would be relief, yet to you affliction, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>8:14</a></td><td class=td>乃是要出于均平，就是要你们的富余，今时可以补他们的不足，为使他们的富余，将来也可以补你们的不足，这就均平了；<br>But it is out of equality; at the present time your abundance for their lack that their abundance also may be for your lack, so that there may be equality; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>8:15</a></td><td class=td>如经上所记：“多收的没有余，少收的也没有缺。”<br>As it is written, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.'' </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>感谢神，把我为你们同样的热诚，赐在提多心里，<br>But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>因他固然接受了恳求，但自己更是热诚，自愿往你们那里去。<br>Because he not only received the entreaty, but being more earnest, he also went forth of his own accord to you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>8:18</a></td><td class=td>我们还打发一位弟兄和他同去，这人在福音上普遍的为众召会所称赞。<br>And we sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches, </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>8:19</a></td><td class=td>不但这样，他也被众召会选出，在我们所服事的这恩典上，和我们同行，是为着主自己的荣耀，也是为着我们的热切。<br>And not only this, but who has also been  by the churches as our fellow traveler in this grace which is being ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord Himself and to demonstrate our eagerness; </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>8:20</a></td><td class=td>这就避免人在我们所服事的这丰裕上，挑剔我们，<br>Avoiding this, that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is being ministered by us. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>8:21</a></td><td class=td>因为我们留心作善美可敬的事，不但在主面前，也在人面前。<br>For we exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>8:22</a></td><td class=td>我们又打发我们的弟兄和他们同去，这人是我们在许多事上，屡次试证为殷勤的，现在他因对你们极其深信，就极其更加殷勤了。<br>And we sent with them our brother, whom we have proved to be diligent in many things many times, yet now much more diligent because of the great confidence he has toward you. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>8:23</a></td><td class=td>论到提多，他是我的同伙和为着你们的同工；至于我们的弟兄们，他们是众召会的使徒，是基督的荣耀。<br>Whether concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you; or our brothers, they are apostles of the churches, they are Christ's glory. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>8:24</a></td><td class=td>所以你们要在众召会面前，向他们显示你们爱心的明证，并我们为你们夸耀的明证。<br>Show therefore to them, in the face of the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
