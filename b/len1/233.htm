<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>1:1</a></td><td class=td>当士师秉政的时候，以色列地遭遇饥荒。有一个人带着妻子和两个儿子，从犹大的伯利恒往摩押乡间去寄居。<br>Now in the days when the judges  ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a man from Bethlehem in Judah went down to dwell as a sojourner in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>1:2</a></td><td class=td>这人名叫以利米勒，他妻子名叫拿俄米；他两个儿子，一个名叫玛伦，一个名叫基连，都是犹大伯利恒的以法他人。他们到了摩押乡间，就住在那里。<br>And the man's name was Elimelech, and his wife's name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>1:3</a></td><td class=td>后来拿俄米的丈夫以利米勒死了，剩下妇人和她两个儿子。<br>And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>1:4</a></td><td class=td>这两个儿子娶了摩押女子为妻，一个名叫俄珥巴，一个名叫路得，在那里住了约有十年。<br>And they took wives for themselves from among the Moabite women. One's name was Orpah, and the second's name was Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>1:5</a></td><td class=td>玛伦和基连二人也死了，剩下妇人拿俄米，两个孩子没有了，丈夫也没有了。<br>And both Mahlon and Chilion died, and the woman was left without her two children and her husband.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>1:6</a></td><td class=td>她就与两个儿媳起身，要从摩押乡间归回；因为她在摩押乡间听见耶和华眷顾祂的百姓，赐粮食与他们。<br>Then she rose up with her daughters-in-law in order to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that Jehovah had visited His people by giving them food.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>1:7</a></td><td class=td>于是她带同两个儿媳，起行离开所在的地方，上路回犹大地去。<br>So she went forth from the place where she had been, along with her two daughters-in-law; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>1:8</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米对两个儿媳说，你们各人回娘家去罢。愿耶和华以恩慈待你们，像你们以恩慈待已死的人与我一样。<br>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go and return, each of you, to your mother's house. May Jehovah deal kindly with you, just as you have dealt with the dead and with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>1:9</a></td><td class=td>愿耶和华使你们各在新夫家中寻得安息。于是拿俄米与她们亲嘴，她们就放声而哭，<br>May Jehovah grant you to find rest, each of you in the house of your husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice and wept.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>1:10</a></td><td class=td>说，不然，我们必与你一同回你本民那里去。<br>And they said to her, No, we will return with you to your people.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>1:11</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米说，我女儿们哪，回去罢。为何要跟我去呢？我腹中还有儿子可以作你们的丈夫么？<br>And Naomi said, Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>1:12</a></td><td class=td>我女儿们哪，回去罢；我年纪老迈，不能再有丈夫。即或我说，我还有指望，今夜有丈夫可以生子，<br>Return, my daughters, go; for I am too old to have a husband. If I said, I have hope; even if I had a husband tonight and even bore sons;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>1:13</a></td><td class=td>你们岂能等着他们长大呢？你们岂能为他们守身不嫁人呢？我女儿们哪，不要这样。我比你们更是愁苦，因为耶和华伸手攻击我。<br>Would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having a husband? No, my daughters; it has been far more bitter for me than it should be for you, for the hand of Jehovah has gone forth against me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>1:14</a></td><td class=td>两个儿媳又放声而哭；俄珥巴与婆婆亲嘴而别，只是路得紧紧随着婆婆。<br>And they lifted up their voice and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother- in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>1:15</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米说，看哪，你嫂子已经回她本民和她的神那里去了，你也跟着你嫂子回去罢。<br>And she said, Your sister-in-law has now returned to her people and to her gods; return with your sister-in-law.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>1:16</a></td><td class=td>路得说，不要催我离开你回去不跟随你。你往那里去，我也往那里去；你在那里住宿，我也在那里住宿；你的民就是我的民，你的神就是我的神。<br>But Ruth said, Do not entreat me to leave you and turn away from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>1:17</a></td><td class=td>你在那里死，我也在那里死，也葬在那里。除非死能使你我相离，不然，愿耶和华重重的降罚与我。<br>Where you die, I will die; and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more as well, if anything but death parts me from you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>1:18</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米见路得定意要跟随自己去，就不再对她说什么了。<br>And when  Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she ceased speaking to her about it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>1:19</a></td><td class=td>于是二人同行，来到伯利恒。她们到了伯利恒，合城的人就都因她们惊动；妇女们说，这不是拿俄米么？<br>So the two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them; and the women said, Is this Naomi?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>1:20</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米对她们说，不要叫我拿俄米，要叫我玛拉，因为全足者使我受了大苦。<br>And she said to them, Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara; for the All-sufficient One has dealt very bitterly with me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>1:21</a></td><td class=td>我满满的出去，耶和华使我空空的回来。耶和华使我受苦，全足者以祸患待我。既是这样，你们为何还叫我拿俄米呢？<br>I went out full, but Jehovah has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, when Jehovah has  afflicted me and the All-sufficient One has dealt harshly with me?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>1:22</a></td><td class=td>拿俄米和她儿媳摩押女子路得，从摩押乡间回来；她们到了伯利恒，正是动手割大麦的时候。<br>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
