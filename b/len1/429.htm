<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>3:3</a></td><td class=td>在王门那里，王的臣仆问末底改说，你为何违犯王的命令呢？<br>Then the king's servants who were in the king's gate said to Mordecai, Why do you transgress the king's command?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>3:6</a></td><td class=td>哈曼不屑只下手害末底改一人，因他们已将末底改的本族告诉他，所以他想要灭绝亚哈随鲁王通国所有的犹大人，就是末底改的本族。<br>But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who the people of Mordecai were; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>3:8</a></td><td class=td>哈曼对亚哈随鲁王说，有一种民散居在王国各省的民中；他们的律例与万民的律例不同，他们也不遵行王的律例，所以容留他们对王并不妥当。<br>And Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples throughout all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws differ from those of all the people, nor do they keep the king's laws.
