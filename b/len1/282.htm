And he would say, Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>15:3</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙对他说，看哪，你的事有情有理，无奈王没有委人听你伸诉。<br>Then Absalom would say to him, See, your matters are good and right, but there is no one  appointed by the king to hear you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>15:4</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙又说，恨不得我被立为这地的士师！凡有争讼求审判的到我这里来，我必为他施行公义。<br>And Absalom would say, Oh that I were made a judge in the land, that every man who had a cause or a matter to be judged would come to me, and I would do him justice!</td></tr>

Return and take your brothers back; lovingkindness and truth be with you.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>15:24</a></td><td class=td>看哪，撒督也来了，所有与他在一起的利未人，也抬着神的约柜来了；他们将神的约柜放下，亚比亚他上来，等着众民尽都从城里出来过去。<br>And there  came Zadok also and all the Levites with him, bearing the Ark of the Covenant of God; and they set the Ark of God down, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished passing over from the city.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>15:25</a></td><td class=td>王对撒督说，你将神的约柜抬回城去。我若在耶和华眼前蒙恩，祂必使我回来，再见约柜和祂的居所。<br>Then the king said to Zadok, Bring the Ark of God back into the city. If I should find favor in the sight of Jehovah, He will bring me back and show me it and His habitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>15:26</a></td><td class=td>倘若祂这样说，我不喜悦你，看哪，我在这里，愿祂照自己所看为好的待我。<br>But if He should say thus, I am not pleased with you, let Him then do with me as it seems good in His sight.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>15:27</a></td><td class=td>王又对祭司撒督说，你不是先见么？你可以安然回城；你儿子亚希玛斯和亚比亚他的儿子约拿单，你们的两个儿子，都可以与你们同去。<br>And the king said to Zadok the priest, You are a seer; return to the city in peace with Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>15:28</a></td><td class=td>看哪，我要在旷野的渡口那里等候，直到有话从你们那里来告诉我。<br>See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>15:29</a></td><td class=td>于是撒督和亚比亚他将神的约柜抬回耶路撒冷，他们就住在那里。<br>So Zadok and Abiathar brought the Ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>15:30</a></td><td class=td>大卫蒙头赤脚由橄榄山的上坡上去，一面上一面哭。跟随他的众人也各自蒙着头上去，一面上一面哭。<br>And David went up the ascent to the  Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up, and he had his head covered and he went barefoot. And all the people who were with him each covered his own head; and they went up, weeping as they went up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>15:31</a></td><td class=td>有人告诉大卫说，亚希多弗也在叛党之中，随从押沙龙。大卫祷告说，耶和华阿，求你使亚希多弗的计谋变为愚拙。<br>Then someone told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, Turn, I pray, the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness, O Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>15:32</a></td><td class=td>大卫到了山顶敬拜神的地方，见亚基人户筛，衣服撕裂，头蒙尘土来迎接他。<br>Then when David came to the summit, where God was worshipped, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and with earth on his head.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>15:33</a></td><td class=td>大卫对他说，你若与我一同过去，必累赘我；<br>And David said to him, If you pass over with me, you will be a burden to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>15:34</a></td><td class=td>你若回城去，对押沙龙说，王阿，我愿作你的仆人；我从前作你父亲的仆人，现在我也照样作你的仆人；这样，你就可以为我破坏亚希多弗的计谋。<br>But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, I am your servant, O king; as I was your father's servant in the past, so will I be your servant now; then you will defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>15:35</a></td><td class=td>祭司撒督和亚比亚他岂不都在那里与你在一起么？你在王宫里听见什么，就要告诉祭司撒督和亚比亚他。<br>And will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be with you there? Therefore whatever you hear from the king's house you shall tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</td></tr>
