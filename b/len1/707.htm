<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>28:3</a></td><td class=td>以法莲酒徒骄傲的冠冕，必被踏在脚下；<br>The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim Will be trodden under foot;</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>28:5</a></td><td class=td>到那日，万军之耶和华必作祂余剩之民的华冠荣冕，<br>In that day Jehovah of hosts Will become a crown of beauty and a diadem of glory to the remnant of His people,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>28:6</a></td><td class=td>也作了在位上行审判者公平的灵，并城门口打退敌阵者的力量。<br>And a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment And strength to those who turn away the battle at the gate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>28:7</a></td><td class=td>但这些人，也因酒摇摇晃晃，因浓酒东倒西歪：祭司和申言者因浓酒摇摇晃晃，因酒昏乱，因浓酒东倒西歪；他们见异象时摇摇晃晃，行审判时摇摆不定。<br>But these also reel with wine And stagger from liquor: The priest and the prophet stagger from liquor; They are swallowed up with wine; They stagger from liquor, They reel in their visions, They totter in their judgments.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>28:8</a></td><td class=td>因为各席上满了呕吐的污秽，无一处干净。<br>For all the tables are full of vomit and filth; There is no place clean.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>28:10</a></td><td class=td>因为他所说的是命令加上命令，命令加上命令，一行又一行，一行又一行，这里一点，那里一点。<br>For his words are: Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; Line upon line, line upon line; Here a little, there a little.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>28:11</a></td><td class=td>申言者说，不然，主要借异邦人的嘴唇，和外邦人的舌头，对这百姓说话；<br>For with stammering lips And with a foreign tongue He will speak to this people,</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>28:12</a></td><td class=td>祂曾对他们说，这就是安息，你们要使疲乏人得安息；又说，这才是舒畅；他们却不肯听。<br>He who said to them, This is rest; give rest to the weary; And, This is repose. But they would not hear.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>28:13</a></td><td class=td>所以耶和华向他们说的话，是命令加上命令，命令加上命令，一行又一行，一行又一行，这里一点，那里一点；以致他们前行仰面跌倒，而且跌碎，并陷入网罗，被缠住。<br>Therefore Jehovah's word to them will be: Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; Line upon line, line upon line; Here a little, there a little; That they may go and stumble backward, And be broken, snared, and taken.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>28:14</a></td><td class=td>所以你们这些亵慢的人，就是辖管在耶路撒冷这百姓的，要听耶和华的话：<br>Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, You scoffing men, Who rule this people Who are in Jerusalem:</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>28:15</a></td><td class=td>因为你们曾说，我们与死亡立了约，与阴间结了盟；敌军如水涨漫经过的时候，必不临到我们；因我们以谎言为避难所，在虚假之内藏身；<br>Because you have said, We have  made A covenant with death, And with Sheol We have made an agreement: When the overflowing scourge passes through, It will not come upon us; For we have made falsehood our refuge And have hidden ourselves in deception.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>28:16</a></td><td class=td>所以主耶和华如此说：看哪，我在锡安放一块石头，作为根基，是试验过的石头，是宝贵的房角石，作为稳固的根基；信靠的人必不着急。<br>Therefore thus says The Lord Jehovah: Indeed I lay a stone in Zion as a foundation, A tested stone, A precious cornerstone as a foundation firmly established; He who believes will not hasten away.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>28:17</a></td><td class=td>我必以公平为准绳，以公义为线铊；冰雹必冲去谎言的避难所，大水必漫过藏身处。<br>And I will make justice the line And righteousness the plummet; And the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, And the waters will overflow the secret place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>28:18</a></td><td class=td>你们与死亡所立的约必然废掉，与阴间所结的盟必立不住；敌军如水涨漫经过的时候，你们必被他们践踏。<br>And your covenant with death will be annulled, And your agreement with Sheol will not stand; When the overflowing scourge passes through, You will be a trampling ground  to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>28:19</a></td><td class=td>每逢他们经过必将你们掳去；因为每早晨他们必经过，白昼黑夜都必如此。明白传言的，必受惊恐。<br>As often as it passes through, It will take hold of you. For morning by morning it will pass through, By day and by night; And it will be nothing but terror To understand the report of it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>28:20</a></td><td class=td>原来床榻短，使人不能舒身；被窝窄，使人不能遮体。<br>For the bed is too short for a man to stretch on, And the sheet is too narrow for him to wrap himself in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>28:21</a></td><td class=td>耶和华必兴起，像在毗拉心山，祂必发怒，像在基遍谷，好作成祂的工，就是非常的工，成就祂的事，就是奇异的事。<br>For Jehovah will rise as on Mount Perazim, He will be agitated as in the valley of Gibeon, To do His deed, His strange deed, And to do His work, His most different work.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>28:22</a></td><td class=td>现在你们不可作亵慢人，恐怕捆你们的绑索更结实；因为我从主万军之耶和华那里听见，要坚决的在全地上施行完全的毁灭。<br>Now therefore do not be mockers, Lest your fetters become stronger; For I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts Of complete and decisive destruction upon the whole  earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>28:23</a></td><td class=td>你们当侧耳听我的声音，留心听我的言语。<br>Hearken and hear my voice; Attend and hear my speech.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>28:24</a></td><td class=td>那耕地为要撒种的，岂是终日耕地呢？岂是不断开垦耙地呢？<br>Does the plowman plow all day long to sow his seed? Does he open and harrow his ground continually?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>28:25</a></td><td class=td>他拉平了地面，岂不就撒种小茴香，播种大茴香，按行列种小麦，在定处种大麦，在田边种粗麦么？<br>Does he not, once he levels the surface, Scatter dill and broadcast cummin, And put the wheat in rows and the barley in its appointed place And the rye where it belongs?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>28:26</a></td><td class=td>因为他的神教导他这样判断，并且这样指教他。<br>For his God instructs him toward such discretion And teaches him so.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>28:27</a></td><td class=td>原来打小茴香不用尖利的器具，轧大茴香也不用碾轮；但用杖打小茴香，用棍打大茴香。<br>For dill is not threshed with a sharp tool, Nor is the cart wheel turned upon the cummin; But dill is beaten out with a rod, And cummin with a stick.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=28>28:28</a></td><td class=td>作饼的谷是用磨磨碎，并不是不停的一打再打；一旦用碾轮和马辊过，就不用磨。<br>Bread grains are ground, Yet one does not thresh and thresh forever. And once the wheel of his cart and his horses drive over it, One does not grind it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>28:29</a></td><td class=td>这也是出于万军之耶和华；祂的谋略奇妙，祂的智慧广大。<br>This also comes forth from Jehovah of hosts, He who makes His counsel extraordinary and His sound wisdom great.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
