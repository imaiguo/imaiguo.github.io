<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>49:2</a></td><td class=td>祂使我的口如快刀，将我藏在祂手荫之下；又使我成为磨亮的箭，将我藏在祂箭袋之中。<br>And He has made my mouth like a sharp sword; He has concealed me in the shadow of His hand, And He has made me a polished arrow; He has hidden me in His quiver.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>49:3</a></td><td class=td>祂对我说，你是我的仆人以色列，我必因你得荣耀。<br>And He said to me, You are My servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>49:5</a></td><td class=td>耶和华从我在胎中就塑造我作祂的仆人，要使雅各归向祂，使以色列聚集到祂那里；我要在耶和华眼中被看为尊荣，我的神也要成为我的力量。<br>And now says Jehovah, Who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, To bring Jacob back to Him, So that Israel would be gathered to Him; And I will be glorified in the sight of Jehovah, And My God will be My strength.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>49:6</a></td><td class=td>祂说，你作我的仆人，使雅各众支派复兴，使以色列中得保全的归回，尚为小事；我还要立你作外邦人的光，叫你施行我的救恩，直到地极。<br>He says, It is too small a thing that You would be My Servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob And bring back the preserved of Israel; I will also set You as a light of the  nations That You may be My salvation unto the ends of the earth.</td></tr>

As I live, declares Jehovah,  You will put all of them on like an ornament And gird yourself with them like a bride.</td></tr>

And who brought these up? Indeed, I was left alone; From where did these come?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>49:22</a></td><td class=td>主耶和华如此说，我必向列国举手，向众民高举我的旌旗；他们必将你的众子抱在怀中带来，将你的众女放在肩上扛来。<br>Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Indeed, I will lift up My hand to the nations, And unto the peoples I will lift up My banner; And they will bring your sons in their arms, And they will carry your daughters on their shoulders.</td></tr>
