Ask for him the kingdom also, since he is my older brother, indeed for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>2:23</a></td><td class=td>所罗门王就指着耶和华起誓说，亚多尼雅说这话是自己送命，不然，愿神重重的降罚与我。<br>Then King Solomon swore by Jehovah saying, God do so to me, and even more, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>2:24</a></td><td class=td>耶和华坚立我，使我坐在我父亲大卫的位上，并照着祂所应许的，为我建立家室；现在我指着永活的耶和华起誓，亚多尼雅今日必被处死。<br>Now therefore as Jehovah lives, who has established me and seated me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house as He has promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death today.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=29>2:29</a></td><td class=td>有人告诉所罗门王说，约押逃到耶和华的帐幕，现今在祭坛的旁边；所罗门就差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，说，你去将他杀死。<br>And when it was told King Solomon that Joab had fled into the Tent of Jehovah and that he was just then beside the altar, Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go and strike him down.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=30>2:30</a></td><td class=td>比拿雅来到耶和华的帐幕，对约押说，王这样说，你出来罢。他说，我不出去，我要死在这里。比拿雅就回话给王说，约押如此说，如此回答我。<br>And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah and said to him, Thus says the king, Come out. And he said, No; rather I will die here. Then Benaiah brought word to the king again, saying, Thus has Joab said, and thus has he answered me.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=31>2:31</a></td><td class=td>王说，你照着他所说的而行，杀死他，将他葬埋，好将约押无故流人血的罪，从我和我的父家除去。<br>And the king said to him, Do as he has spoken, and strike him down and bury him, that you may remove the blood which Joab has shed without cause from me and from my father's house.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=32>2:32</a></td><td class=td>耶和华必将约押流人血的罪，报应在他自己的头上；因为他击杀两个比他又义又好的人，就是以色列的元帅，尼珥的儿子押尼珥，和犹大的元帅，益帖的儿子亚玛撒，用刀杀了他们，我父亲大卫却不知道。<br>And Jehovah will return his blood upon his head because he struck down two men more righteous and better than himself and slew them with the sword, though my father David did not know of it, that is, Abner the son of Ner, the captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, the captain of the army of Judah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=33>2:33</a></td><td class=td>故此，流这二人血的罪必报应在约押和他后裔的头上，直到永远；<br>So their blood shall return upon Joab's head and upon his seed's head forever, but to David and to his seed and to his house and to his throne there shall be peace forever from Jehovah.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=34>2:34</a></td><td class=td>惟有大卫和他的后裔，并他的家与国位，必从耶和华那里得平安，直到永远。于是耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅上去，击杀约押，将他杀死，葬在旷野约押自己的宅地里。<br>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and killed him, and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=35>2:35</a></td><td class=td>王就立耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅统领军队，代替约押，又使祭司撒督代替亚比亚他。<br>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king put Zadok the priest in Abiathar's place.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=36>2:36</a></td><td class=td>王差遣人将示每召来，对他说，你要在耶路撒冷为自己建造房屋居住，不可出来往别处去。<br>Then the king sent word and called for Shimei. And he said to him, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there; and you shall not go forth from there to any place whatever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=37>2:37</a></td><td class=td>你当确实的知道，你何日出来过汲沦溪，何日必死；流你血的罪必归到你自己的头上。<br>For on the day that you go forth and cross over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall surely die; your blood will be upon your own head.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=38>2:38</a></td><td class=td>示每对王说，这话甚好；我主我王怎样说，仆人必怎样行。于是示每多日住在耶路撒冷。<br>And Shimei said to the king, This word is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. So Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=39>2:39</a></td><td class=td>过了三年，示每的两个仆人逃到迦特王玛迦的儿子亚吉那里去；有人告诉示每说，看哪，你的仆人在迦特。<br>Then at the end of three years two of Shimei's servants ran off to Achish the son of Maacah, the king of Gath; and they told Shimei, saying, Your servants are now in Gath.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=40>2:40</a></td><td class=td>于是示每起来，备上驴，往迦特到亚吉那里去找他的仆人。示每去了，就从迦特带他仆人回来。<br>So Shimei rose up and saddled his donkey and went to Gath, unto Achish, to seek his servants. And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.</td></tr>

And you said to me, This word that I have heard is good.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=43>2:43</a></td><td class=td>现在你为何不谨守你指着耶和华起的誓，和我所吩咐你的命令呢？<br>Why then have you not kept the oath of Jehovah and the commandment that I charged you with?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=45>2:45</a></td><td class=td>惟有所罗门王必得福，并且大卫的国位必在耶和华面前坚定，直到永远。<br>But King Solomon will be blessed, and the throne of David will be established before Jehovah forever.</td></tr>
