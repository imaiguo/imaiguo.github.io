<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>10:22</a></td><td class=td>所以他们又问耶和华说，有另一个人要到这里来么？耶和华说，看哪，他藏身在物件中间。<br>Therefore they asked of Jehovah again, Is there yet  another man coming here? And Jehovah said, There  he is; he has hidden himself among the baggage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>10:23</a></td><td class=td>众人就跑去从那里领出他来。他站在百姓中间，身体比众民高过一头。<br>And they ran and took him from there. And when he stood up among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders and up.</td></tr>
