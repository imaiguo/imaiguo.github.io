<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>7:1</a></td><td class=td>我想医治以色列的时候，以法莲的罪孽和撒玛利亚的恶行就显露出来；因为他们行事虚谎。内有贼人入室偷窃，外有强盗成群抢劫。<br>When I would heal Israel, Then the iniquity of Ephraim is discovered As well as the evil deeds of Samaria; For they practice falsehood. And the thief comes inside; The band of robbers makes raids outside.</td></tr>

Their princes will fall by the sword Because of the rage of their tongue. This will be their derision In the land of Egypt.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
