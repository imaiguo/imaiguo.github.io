<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>到了王门前停住脚步，因为穿麻衣的不可进王门。<br>And he went up to the entrance of the king's gate, for no one was to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>王的谕旨和法令所到的各省各处，犹大人大大悲哀，禁食哭泣哀号，穿麻衣躺在灰中的甚多。<br>And throughout every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and wailing; many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>王后以斯帖的宫女和太监来把这事告诉以斯帖，她甚是忧愁，就送衣服给末底改穿，要他脱下麻衣，他却不接受。<br>And Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and told her, and the queen was greatly distressed. And she sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might remove his sackcloth from him; but he would not accept them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>以斯帖就把王所派伺候她的一个太监，名叫哈他革召来，吩咐他去见末底改，要知道这是什么事，是为什么缘故。<br>Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to serve her, and she commanded him to go out to Mordecai to find out what this was and why it was.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>4:6</a></td><td class=td>于是哈他革出到王门前城的宽阔处，见末底改。<br>So Hathach went out to Mordecai at the open square of the city in front of the king's gate.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>4:8</a></td><td class=td>又将所抄写在书珊颁布，要灭绝犹大人的法令交给哈他革，要他给以斯帖看，向她说明，并嘱咐她进去见王，向王求情，为本族的人在王面前恳求。<br>And he also gave him a copy of the written decree which was issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show Esther and tell her about it and charge her to go in to the king to supplicate him and make a request for her people before him.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>4:13</a></td><td class=td>末底改叫人回覆以斯帖说，你不要以为在王宫里就强过一切犹大人，得免这祸。<br>Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, Do not imagine that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the Jews.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>4:14</a></td><td class=td>此时你若闭口不言，犹大人必从别处得解脱，蒙拯救；你和你父家就必灭亡。焉知你得了王后的位分，不是为现今这样的时机么？<br>For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from some other place, and you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</td></tr>

And so will I go in to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.</td></tr>
