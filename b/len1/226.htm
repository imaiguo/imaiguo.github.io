<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>15:1</a></td><td class=td>过了些日子，到割麦子的时候，参孙带着一只山羊羔去看他的妻子，说，我要进内室见我的妻子。他岳父不让他进去，<br>Then after some time, during the days of the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a kid. And he said, Let me go into the chamber to my wife; but her father would not allow him to go in.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>15:2</a></td><td class=td>说，我估定你是极其恨她，因此我将她给了你的伴友。她的妹妹不是比她还美么？可以代替她归给你罢。<br>And her father said, I surely thought that you utterly hated her, so I gave her to your best man. Is not her younger sister better than she? Let her be yours instead of her.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>15:3</a></td><td class=td>参孙对他们说，这次我虽然加害非利士人，我对他们也不算有罪。<br>Then Samson said to them, This time I will be blameless with regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>15:4</a></td><td class=td>于是参孙去捉了三百只狐狸，又取了火把来，将狐狸尾巴对着尾巴捆上，将一枝火把捆在两条尾巴中间；<br>And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches and turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch in between every two tails.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>15:5</a></td><td class=td>他点着火把，就放狐狸进入非利士人站着的禾稼，将堆积的禾捆和站着的禾稼，并葡萄园、橄榄园尽都烧了。<br>Then he set the torches on fire and sent the foxes into the Philistines' standing grain and burned up the shocks and the standing grain as well as the vineyards and the olive groves.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>15:6</a></td><td class=td>非利士人说，这事是谁作的？有人说，是亭拿人的女婿参孙，因为他岳父将他的妻子给了他的伴友。于是非利士人上去，用火烧了妇人和她的父亲。<br>And the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they said, Samson, the son- in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his best man. And the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>15:7</a></td><td class=td>参孙对非利士人说，你们既然这样行，我必向你们报仇才肯罢休。<br>And Samson said to them, If this is how you act, I will surely take revenge on you, and then I will stop.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>15:8</a></td><td class=td>参孙就大大击杀他们，连腿带腰都砍断了。随后他下去，住在以坦磐石的穴内。<br>And he struck them hip and thigh, a great slaughter. And he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>15:9</a></td><td class=td>非利士人上去安营在犹大，散开攻击利希。<br>And the Philistines rose up and encamped in Judah, and they spread out against Lehi.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>15:10</a></td><td class=td>犹大人说，你们为何上来攻击我们呢？他们说，我们上来是要捆绑参孙；他向我们怎样行，我们也要向他怎样行。<br>And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? And they said, We have come up to bind Samson, so that we can do to him as he has done to us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>15:11</a></td><td class=td>于是有三千犹大人下到以坦磐石的穴内，对参孙说，非利士人辖制我们，你不知道么？你向我们行的是什么事呢？他回答说，他们向我怎样行，我也向他们怎样行。<br>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam; and they said to Samson, Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? Then what is this that you have done to us? And he said to them, As they have done to me, so I have done to them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>15:12</a></td><td class=td>犹大人对他说，我们下来是要捆绑你，将你交在非利士人手中。参孙说，你们要向我起誓，应承你们自己不杀害我。<br>And they said to him, We have come down to bind you up so that we can deliver you into hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall upon me yourselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>15:13</a></td><td class=td>他们说，我们只要将你捆绑交在非利士人手中，我们断不会杀你。于是用两条新绳捆绑参孙，将他从以坦磐石带上去。<br>And they spoke to him, saying, No, we will only bind you and deliver you into their hand, but we certainly will not put you to death. And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>15:14</a></td><td class=td>参孙到了利希，非利士人都迎着呐喊。耶和华的灵冲击参孙，他臂上的绳就像火烧的麻一样，他的绑绳都从他手上脱落下来。<br>When he came into Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax when it burns in fire; and his bonds melted from off his hands.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>15:15</a></td><td class=td>他见一块未干的驴腮骨，就伸手拾起来，用以击杀一千人。<br>And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass; and he stretched out his hand and took it, and struck a thousand men with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>15:16</a></td><td class=td>参孙说，我用驴腮骨杀人成堆，用驴腮骨杀了一千人。<br>And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, A heap upon a double heap; With the jawbone of an ass, I have struck a thousand men dead.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>15:17</a></td><td class=td>说完这话，就把那腮骨从手里抛出去了；他便把那地方叫作拉末利希。<br>And when he finished speaking, he cast the jawbone from his hand; and he called that place Ramath-lehi.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>15:18</a></td><td class=td>参孙甚觉口渴，就呼求耶和华说，你既借仆人的手施行这么大的拯救，我现在岂可渴死，落在未受割礼的人手中？<br>And he was very thirsty, and he called on Jehovah, saying, You have granted this great victory by the hand of Your servant. And will I now die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>15:19</a></td><td class=td>神就使利希的洼处裂开，有水从其中涌出来。参孙喝了，灵里得恢复，就复苏过来；因此他给那泉起名叫隐哈歌利，那泉直到今日还在利希。<br>But God broke open the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came forth from it. And when he drank, his spirit returned and he was revived; therefore he called the name of  that place En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>15:20</a></td><td class=td>当非利士人辖制以色列人的时候，参孙作以色列的士师二十年。<br>And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
