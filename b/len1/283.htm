<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>16:2</a></td><td class=td>王问洗巴说，你带这些来是什么意思？洗巴说，驴是给王的家眷骑的，饼和夏天的果品是给少年人吃的，酒是给在旷野疲乏的人喝的。<br>And the king said to Ziba, Why do you have these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on, and the bread and the summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those who faint in the wilderness to drink.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>16:10</a></td><td class=td>王说，洗鲁雅的儿子，我与你们何干？他咒骂，若是因耶和华告诉他要咒骂大卫，如此，谁敢说你为什么这样行呢？<br>But the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if Jehovah has told him to curse David, who then can say, Why have you done so?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>16:11</a></td><td class=td>大卫又对亚比筛和众臣仆说，我亲生的儿子尚且寻索我的性命，何况这便雅悯人呢？由他咒骂罢，因为这是耶和华告诉他的。<br>And David said to Abishai and all his servants, Now my son, who came forth from my body, seeks my life; how much more then this Benjaminite will do so.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>16:20</a></td><td class=td>押沙龙对亚希多弗说，你们定个计谋，我们怎样行才好。<br>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your counsel as to what we should do.</td></tr>
