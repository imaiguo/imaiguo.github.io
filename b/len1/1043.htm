<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>25:3</a></td><td class=td>不断恳求非斯都，向他求情对付保罗，将他提到耶路撒冷来，他们要在路上埋伏杀害他。<br>Asking for a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem, they themselves setting an ambush to do away with him on the way. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>25:4</a></td><td class=td>非斯都就回答说，保罗押在该撒利亚，我不久就要亲自往那里去。<br>Festus therefore answered that Paul was being kept in custody in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to proceed there shortly. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>25:5</a></td><td class=td>又说，你们中间有权势的人与我一同下去，那人若有什么不是，就可以告他。<br>Therefore, he said, let influential men from among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>25:6</a></td><td class=td>非斯都在他们中间，住了不过十天八天，就下该撒利亚去，第二天坐在审判台上，吩咐将保罗提上来。<br>And having stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>25:8</a></td><td class=td>保罗分诉说，无论犹太人的律法，或是圣殿，或是该撒，我都没有得罪过。<br>While Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned in anything. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>25:9</a></td><td class=td>但非斯都要讨好犹太人，就回答保罗说，关于这些事，你愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里在我面前受审么？<br>But Festus, wanting to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me concerning these things? </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>25:10</a></td><td class=td>保罗说，我是站在该撒的审判台前，这是我应当受审的地方；我向犹太人并没有行过什么不对的事，这也是你明明知道的。<br>And Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>25:11</a></td><td class=td>我若行了不对的事，犯了什么该死的罪，就是死，我也不辞；但他们所告我的事，若都是虚的，就没有人可以把我交给他们。我上诉于该撒。<br>If therefore I am doing wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing to the things which these accuse me of, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>25:12</a></td><td class=td>非斯都和议会商量了，就回答说，你既上诉于该撒，就要往该撒那里去。<br>Then when Festus had conferred with the council, he answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>25:13</a></td><td class=td>过了些日子，亚基帕王和百尼基氏来到该撒利亚，问候非斯都。<br>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus. </td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>25:15</a></td><td class=td>我在耶路撒冷的时候，祭司长和犹太人的长老，将他的事禀报了我，求我定他的罪。<br>Concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information and asked for a sentence against him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>25:16</a></td><td class=td>我回答他们说，无论什么人，被告还没有和原告当面对质，未得机会分诉所告他的事，就先把他交给对方，这不是罗马人的规例。<br>To them I answered that it is not the custom with Romans to hand over any man before he who is accused meets the accusers face to face and has an opportunity for a defense concerning the charge. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>25:17</a></td><td class=td>及至他们都来到这里，我就不耽延，第二天便坐在审判台上，吩咐把那人提上来。<br>So when they had come together here, I made no delay; on the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, I ordered the man to be brought. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>25:18</a></td><td class=td>原告站着告他，所告的并没有我所意料的恶事；<br>Concerning him the accusers stood and brought no charge of the evil things I was suspecting. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>25:19</a></td><td class=td>不过是和保罗争论一些他们自己敬鬼神的问题，又关于一位已经死了的耶稣，保罗断言祂是活着的。<br>But they had certain questions against him concerning their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>25:20</a></td><td class=td>关于这些争论，我心里作难，就问他愿不愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里为这些事受审。<br>And being at a loss as to how there should be an inquiry concerning these things, I asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these things. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>25:21</a></td><td class=td>但保罗诉求把他留下，等待皇上审断，我就吩咐把他留下，等我解他到该撒那里去。<br>But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I should send him up to Caesar. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=22>25:22</a></td><td class=td>亚基帕对非斯都说，我也愿意亲自听听这个人。非斯都说，明天你可以听他。<br>And Agrippa said to Festus, I myself also would like to hear the man. Tomorrow, said Festus, you shall hear him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=23>25:23</a></td><td class=td>第二天，亚基帕和百尼基大张威势而来，同着众千夫长和城里杰出的人，进了厅堂；非斯都吩咐一声，就有人将保罗提上来。<br>Therefore on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered into the hall of audience together with the commanders and prominent men of the city, and when Festus had given the order, Paul was brought. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=24>25:24</a></td><td class=td>非斯都说，亚基帕王和同我们在座的诸位，你们看这人，为了他，耶路撒冷和这里全群的犹太人曾向我恳求，嚷着说，这个人不该再活着。<br>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you men who are present with us, you behold this man, concerning whom all the multitude of Jews have petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=25>25:25</a></td><td class=td>但我查明他没有犯什么该死的罪，并且他自己既然要上诉于皇上，我就定意把他解去。<br>But I found that he had done nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=26>25:26</a></td><td class=td>论到这人，我没有确实的事可以呈奏主上；因此我带他到你们面前，也特意带他到你亚基帕王面前，为要在审问之后，有所陈奏。<br>Concerning him I have nothing definite to write to my lord; therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that when the examination has taken place, I may have something to write. </td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=27>25:27</a></td><td class=td>据我看来，解送囚犯，不指明他的罪状，是不合理的。<br>For it seems unreasonable to me, in sending a prisoner, not to also signify the charges against him. </td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
