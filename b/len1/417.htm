<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>4:2</a></td><td class=td>对他弟兄和撒玛利亚的军兵说，这些软弱的犹大人作什么呢？他们要为自己修筑城墙么？要献祭么？要一日完成么？要从土堆里拿出火烧的石头再立墙么？<br>And he spoke to his brothers and the army of Samaria and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore it for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the dust heaps, though they are burned?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>4:3</a></td><td class=td>亚扪人多比雅站在旁边，说，他们所建造的石墙，就是狐狸上去也必踩出洞来。<br>And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, Even their stone wall that they are building, if a fox were to go up on it, he would breach it.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>4:4</a></td><td class=td>我们的神阿，求你垂听，因为我们被藐视；求你使他们的凌辱归在他们头上，使他们在被掳到之地成为掠物。<br>Hear, O our God, for we are despised; and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them as spoil in the land of captivity;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>4:5</a></td><td class=td>不要遮掩他们的罪孽，不要使他们的罪从你面前涂抹，因为他们在建造的人面前惹动你的怒气。<br>And do not cover their iniquity and do not let their sin be blotted out before You, for they made provocations before the builders.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>4:16</a></td><td class=td>从那日起，我的仆人一半作工，一半拿枪、拿盾牌、拿弓、穿铠甲；官长都站在犹大家众人的后边。<br>And from that day half of my servants labored in the work, and half of them held the spears and the shields and the bows and the armor; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>4:19</a></td><td class=td>我对贵胄、官长、和其余的百姓说，这工程浩大，我们在城墙上彼此相离甚远；<br>And I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, each far from the other.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>4:20</a></td><td class=td>你们听见角声在那里，就要聚集到我们那里去。我们的神必为我们争战。<br>In whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, gather yourselves to us there. Our God will fight for us.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=21>4:21</a></td><td class=td>于是，我们作工，其中一半拿枪，从天亮直到星宿出现的时候。<br>So we labored in the work; and half of them held spears from the start of dawn until the stars came out.</td></tr>
