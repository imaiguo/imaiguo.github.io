<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>8:1</a></td><td class=td>谁如智慧人呢？谁知道事情的解释呢？人的智慧使他的脸发光，并使他脸上的戾气改变。<br>Who is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the sternness of his face is changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>8:2</a></td><td class=td>我劝你遵守王的命令；因为这是你在神前起的誓。<br>I say, Keep the commandment of the king, and that, because of the oath before God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>8:3</a></td><td class=td>不要急着离开王的面前，不要参与恶事，因为凡王所喜悦的事，他都要行。<br>Do not hurry to leave him; do not  join in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>8:4</a></td><td class=td>王的话本有权力，谁会问他说，你在作什么呢？<br>For the king's word is powerful, and who will say to him, What are you doing?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>8:5</a></td><td class=td>凡遵守命令的，必不经历祸患；智慧人的心能晓得时机和定例。<br>He who keeps the commandment will know nothing evil, and a wise man's heart will know the proper time and manner.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>8:6</a></td><td class=td>各样事务成就都有时机和定例，纵然人的苦难重压在他身上；<br>For there is a proper time and manner for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy upon him;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>8:7</a></td><td class=td>他不知道将来的事，因为将来如何，谁能告诉他呢？<br>For he does not know what will be, for who can tell him how it will be?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>8:8</a></td><td class=td>无人有权力掌管气息，将气息留住；也无人有权力掌管死期；在争战时，无人能免役，邪恶也不能救自己的主人。<br>There is no man who has power over his  breath to retain his  breath, and no one has power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the battle, nor will wickedness deliver its own master.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>8:9</a></td><td class=td>这一切我都见过，也专心查考日光之下所作的一切事；有时这人管辖那人，使他受害。<br>All this I have seen, and I applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun when a man overpowers another man to his hurt.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>8:10</a></td><td class=td>然后我见恶人得以埋葬，他们生前进入并离开圣处，却在他们这样行的城中被人忘记。这也是虚空。<br>And then I saw the wicked buried, who before had gone in and come forth from the holy place and were forgotten in the city where they had thus acted. This also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>8:11</a></td><td class=td>因为对恶事的判决不立刻执行，所以世人满心作恶。<br>Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set within them to do evil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=12>8:12</a></td><td class=td>罪人虽然作恶百次，倒享长寿；然而我也知道，敬畏神的，就是在祂面前敬畏的人，终久必得福乐。<br>Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I also know that it will be well with the God- fearing who are in fear before Him;</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>8:13</a></td><td class=td>恶人却不得福乐，也不得享长寿；他的日子好像影儿，因他在神面前不存敬畏。<br>But it will not be well with the wicked man, nor will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he is not in fear before God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=14>8:14</a></td><td class=td>地上有一件虚空的事，就是义人照恶人所行的遭报，又有恶人照义人所行的遭报。我说，这也是虚空。<br>There is a vanity that is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom things happen according to the deeds of the wicked and there are wicked men to whom things happen according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this also is vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=15>8:15</a></td><td class=td>我就称赞快乐，原来人在日光之下，莫强如吃喝快乐；因为在日光之下神所赐他一生的日子里，这必在他的劳碌中，时常伴随他。<br>So I praised pleasure, because there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and to drink and to rejoice; for that will stay with him in his labor during the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>8:16</a></td><td class=td>我专心要认识智慧，要看地上所作一切辛劳的事。(有昼夜不睡觉不合眼的。)<br>When I set my heart to know wisdom and to see the travail that is done on the earth (even though  man's eyes do not see sleep day or night),</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>8:17</a></td><td class=td>我就看明神一切的作为，知道人查不出日光之下所作的事；因为任凭人劳碌寻索，都找不出来；智慧人虽说他必知道，也找不出来。<br>Then I saw every work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun, because however man labors to seek it out, he will not find it out; and even if the wise man says that he will come to know it, he is not able to find it out.</td></tr><tr><td class=td colspan=2>&nbsp;</td></tr>
