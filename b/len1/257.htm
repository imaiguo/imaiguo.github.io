So I have made an appointment with my young men at such and such a place.</td></tr>

How much more then today will their vessels be holy!</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>21:6</a></td><td class=td>祭司就拿圣饼给他；因为在那里没有别的饼，只有陈设饼，是当时为了放上热的饼，从耶和华面前撤下来的。<br>So the priest gave him what was holy, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence, which was taken from before Jehovah, to be replaced by hot bread at the time it was taken.</td></tr>

If you will take it, take  it; for there is no other here but that one. And David said, There is none like it; give it to me.</td></tr>

Is this not him of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying, Saul has struck down his thousands; But David, his ten thousands?</td></tr>
