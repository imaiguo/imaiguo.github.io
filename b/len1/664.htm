<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=1>5:1</a></td><td class=td>你到神的殿要谨慎脚步；近前聆听，胜过愚昧人献祭；因为他们不知道所作的是恶。<br>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God, and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know that they are doing evil.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=2>5:2</a></td><td class=td>你在神面前不可冒失开口，也不可心急发言；因为神在天上，你在地上，所以你的言语要寡少。<br>Do not be rash with your mouth, and let not your heart hastily utter anything before God; for God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=3>5:3</a></td><td class=td>烦扰多，令人作梦；言语多，显出愚昧。<br>For a dream comes through a multitude of travail, and a fool's voice through a multitude of words.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=4>5:4</a></td><td class=td>你向神许愿，偿还不可迟延，因祂不喜悦愚昧人。你许了愿，就当偿还。<br>When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it; for He takes no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=5>5:5</a></td><td class=td>你许愿不还，不如不许。<br>It is better that you do not vow than that you vow and not pay.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=6>5:6</a></td><td class=td>不可任你的口使肉体犯罪，也不可在使者面前说是错许了。为何使神因你的声音发怒，败坏你手所作的呢？<br>Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the works of your hands?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=7>5:7</a></td><td class=td>多梦和多言，其中也都是虚空；你只要敬畏神。<br>For in the multitude of dreams and in many words are also vanities. Rather, fear God.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=8>5:8</a></td><td class=td>你若在一省之中见穷人受欺压，公义和公理被夺去，不要因此诧异；因有一位高过居高位的在鉴察；在他们以上还有更高的。<br>If you see the oppression of the poor and the wresting of justice and righteousness in a province, do not be astonished at the matter; for one higher official watches over another high official, and there are higher officials over them.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=9>5:9</a></td><td class=td>君王注重田地的耕种，对国总是有益。<br>And a king who cultivates the field is always an advantage for a land.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=10>5:10</a></td><td class=td>爱银子的，不因得银子知足；爱丰富的，也不因有收入知足。这也是虚空。<br>He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, nor he who loves abundance with income. This is also vanity.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=11>5:11</a></td><td class=td>货物增多，吃的人也增多，物主得什么益处呢？不过眼看而已。<br>When goods increase, those who eat them increase; so what advantage do their owners have except to see them with their eyes?</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=13>5:13</a></td><td class=td>我见日光之下有一大祸患，就是财主守住财富，反害自己。<br>There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches kept by their owner to his own hurt,</td></tr>

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=16>5:16</a></td><td class=td>他来的情形怎样，他去的情形也怎样，这也是一大祸患；他为风劳碌有什么益处呢？<br>And this also is a grievous evil: in all points, as he came, so will he go; so what is the advantage to him who has labored for the wind?</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>5:17</a></td><td class=td>他终身在黑暗中吃喝，多有烦恼、病痛、愤怨。<br>Throughout all his days he also eats in darkness and has much vexation and sickness and resentment.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=18>5:18</a></td><td class=td>我所见为善为美的，就是人在神赐他一生有数的日子吃喝，在日光之下一切劳碌中享美福，因为这是他的分。<br>Here is what I have seen to be good and what is pleasant: to eat and to drink and to taste enjoyment in all his labor by which he labors under the sun during the few days of his life, which God has given him; for this is his portion.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>5:19</a></td><td class=td>神赐各人赀财丰富，使他能以吃用，能取自己的分，在他劳碌中快乐，这乃是神的恩赐。<br>Moreover, for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has empowered him to eat of them and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labor-this is the gift of God.</td></tr>
