<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=17>22:17</a></td><td class=td>米该雅说，我看见以色列众民散在山上，如同没有牧人的羊群一般。耶和华说，这些人没有主人，他们可以平平安安的各归各家去。<br>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd.

<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=19>22:19</a></td><td class=td>米该雅说，因此，你要听耶和华的话；我看见耶和华坐在宝座上，天上的万军侍立在祂左右。<br>And Micaiah said, Hear therefore the word of Jehovah, I saw Jehovah sitting upon His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him, on His right hand and on His left.</td></tr>
<tr><td class=td width="5"><a name=20>22:20</a></td><td class=td>耶和华说，谁去引诱亚哈，使他上基列的拉末去，倒毙在那里呢？这个就这样说，那个就那样说。<br>And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said after this manner, and another said after that manner.</td></tr>
